- What do you think about everything is going on there?
- It's bad
- When you think about Comparing Chinese to American and Americans are kinda lazy, but Chinese they get that shit done over there.
- In China they take extreme measures like very efficient measures for the greater good. I think China handle tin he way better, like way more efficient.
- I think people just argue instead of get shit done. cus apparently like conflicts are more entertaining.
- People like to blame others vesus actually taking measures themselves. You know it's always easy to blame others than taking actual measures.
- I feel like I don't know how to slim it down, cus every time I try to contour it I end up making it look bigger than actually.
- Maybe you gotta watch more of youtube tutorials then.
