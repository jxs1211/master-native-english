Keep your Career on Track

Today's workplace looks pretty different from the one your parents worked in. Walk
into an average office and you'll immediately be **struck** by the fact that it only seems
half full. Remote work  has become the **norm**. And the people themselves may look different. The baby **boomers** are retiring, and younger generations are entering the workforce, often with different values and expectations. So now might be a good time to think about how your expectations have changed. How has your approach to your work and career evolved? Do you see yourself in a position to benefit from the current situation?

With the Great Resignation causing staffing shortages the world over, this is a great
time to reflect on your career. You may be able to ask for more, whether that's in
salary, vacation time, benefits, or other things. Competition for talent is **stiff**,
and companies around the world are working hard to retain what they have.

Some companies actually do "stay interviews," when they meet with employees and
ask how to keep them satisfied. Even if your company doesn't follow this **practice**, it can
be a good idea to arrange to meet with your manager to discuss your short and long-
term goals. There may be opportunities for advancement within your company, but you
need to **put yourself out there** and make it known that you're looking to grow.
Of course, not everyone will be in a position to benefit from these opportunities. Not
everyone has shown they can **adapt** to all the changes. You need to actually prove
yourself, to clearly demonstrate to your employer your value in the post-pandemic
workplace. So, sit down and write out your accomplishments over the past couple of
years.

When you do this, think about all the ways you've adapted. Be prepared to show
that you've **embraced** new technologies and new ways of working. Highlight your
involvement in crisis management or bringing in new ways of working. Show that
you're change ready and can embrace new ideas. Even better, look for opportunities to 
show how you not only **kept pace with** change but how you led change.

Many businesses are still **struggling financially**. And although you may be a valued
employee, the company may simply be unable to give you that big raise you think
you deserve. So be sensitive to our employerâ€™s position while **advocating** strongly
for your own position. Asking for too much at the wrong time may backfire.
 
But you can **demonstrate** how you've adapted in these uncertain times. Show your employer that you're built for the 21stcentury workplace. Show that you're built to lead. The rewards for your talents are out there, but it's up to you to go out and get them.
Good luck!
