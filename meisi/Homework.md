According to my dad…. This information is true.

One closed question fired right after another can make a conversation feel more like a shallow, stilted interview.

It’s not that you should never ask closed questions. They’re sometimes necessary for soliciting specific information. And they’re typically how you begin a conversation in the first place: Where are you from? What do you do?

Where are you from? I’m from Chicago.
What was it like to… grow up in such a big city?

Compatibility 
Hey, have you ever thought about how compatible our Chinese zodiac signs/animals are with each other?
Not really, why do you ask?
Well, I was just reading about how the dragon and ox signs are supposed to be quite compatible. I'm a dragon since I was born in 1988. What animal are you again?
Actually, I am an ox. What makes them so compatible?
So, the article said that the dragon and ox have complementary personalities. The dragon is ambitious and confident, while the ox is hardworking and reliable. Together, they pretty much seem unstoppable.
Yeah, I see that, I think my dependability would balance out your boldness.
Exactly! And your steady and practical approach would help me focus and achieve my goals. It's said that the dragon and ox make a great team in both personal and professional life.
That's interesting. I never thought about it that way. I guess it's worth considering when looking for a partner or a business partner. Could you send me the link to the article?
Yeah sure, I’ll message it to you.

compatible: to work or be together without conflict, fits together, get along with
‘Wow, their relationship is so nice! I always knew that they would be compatible.’ ‘This machine and that electric plug is not compatible.’
signs: Zodiac signs, Chinese Zodiac (12 animals) Astrological Zodiac (the images made up from the stars in the sky, constellations)
‘I was born in the year of the Dog and I was also born in April, so my astrological sign is Aries.
Steady/stable: doesn’t change easily
‘I like my job. The pay is steady and the work isn’t too tough.’
complementary: notice the “e” in the spelling, this means that when you combine two or more things, they make each other better or bring out even better qualities complement v/n
ambitious: strong desire to succeed
reliable: trustworthy, steady consistently good in quality, dependable ‘This laptop is...’
dependability: trustworthy and reliable 
boldness/ambitious: confidence to take risks and act in a new way
