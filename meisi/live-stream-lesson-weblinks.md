Man Survives On Ketchup For Weeks While Lost In The Caribbean Sea
	The man survived by eating ketchup for weeks while he was lost at sea.
Ketchup番茄酱
The origin of the word ketchup is from Cantonese.粤语

Elvis Francois ［fran-swah］ survived for 24 days in the Caribbean with only ketchup, garlic powder大蒜粉, and bouillon 鸡精块cubes to eat.


The Caribbean is known for its beautiful beaches, crystal clear water, and laid-back lifestyle. But for one man, paradise quickly turned into a nightmare after he was lost off the coast of Saint Martin with only ketchup to eat.

Elvis Francois, 47, was found 120 nautical miles from Colombia’s Puerto Bolívar on Jan. 16th after a plane spotted the word “HELP” engraved on the hull of Francois’ sailboat, the Colombian navy reported in a tweet.

He had been lost at sea for 24 days,

“I had no food. It was just a bottle of ketchup that was on the boat, garlic powder and Maggi (bouillon cubes) so I mixed it up with some water,” Francois said in a video recorded by his rescuers.

Francois, who is originally from the island of Dominica, remarked that he had been making repairs to his boat off the coast of Saint Martin in December when bad weather conditions pulled the vessel out to sea.

He explained that he lacked the navigational skills to direct himself back to shore, and so his weeks-long ordeal began.

“I tried to [go] back to port, but I lost track because it took me a while to mount the sail and fix the sail,” Francois said. “I [called] my friends, my coworkers. They tried to contact me, but they lost service. There was nothing else I could do than sit down and wait.”

Over the 24-day period that Francois was lost at sea, he had only condiments for nourishment, and he used a cloth to collect rainwater. He spent his time trying to keep water out of his sailboat and attempting to attract attention by lighting a fire, which failed.

“Twenty-four days — no land, nobody to talk to. Don’t know what to do, don’t know where you are. It was rough,” he said. “At a certain time, I lose hope. I think about my family.”

If someone is not laid back, that means they’re not super serious.

Nautical mile 海里, equal to 1.852km

I was proud of myself for knowing the Chinese for engrave, so I said “go me”
	Congratulating myself!
	It means “I did it!”
	加油 (对我自己说的)
