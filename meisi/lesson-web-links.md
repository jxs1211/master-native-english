Man Survives On Ketchup For Weeks While Lost In The Caribbean Sea
	The man survived by eating ketchup for weeks while he was lost at sea.
Ketchup番茄酱
The origin of the word ketchup is from Cantonese.粤语

Elvis Francois ［fran-swah］ survived for 24 days in the Caribbean with only ketchup, garlic powder大蒜粉, and bouillon 鸡精块cubes to eat.


The Caribbean is known for its beautiful beaches, crystal clear water, and laid-back lifestyle. But for one man, paradise quickly turned into a nightmare after he was lost off the coast of Saint Martin with only ketchup to eat.

Elvis Francois, 47, was found 120 nautical miles from Colombia’s Puerto Bolívar on Jan. 16th after a plane spotted the word “HELP” engraved on the hull of Francois’ sailboat, the Colombian navy reported in a tweet.

He had been lost at sea for 24 days,

“I had no food. It was just a bottle of ketchup that was on the boat, garlic powder and Maggi (bouillon cubes) so I mixed it up with some water,” Francois said in a video recorded by his rescuers.

Francois, who is originally from the island of Dominica, remarked that he had been making repairs to his boat off the coast of Saint Martin in December when bad weather conditions pulled the vessel out to sea.

He explained that he lacked the navigational skills to direct himself back to shore, and so his weeks-long ordeal began.

“I tried to [go] back to port, but I lost track because it took me a while to mount the sail and fix the sail,” Francois said. “I [called] my friends, my coworkers. They tried to contact me, but they lost service. There was nothing else I could do than sit down and wait.”

Over the 24-day period that Francois was lost at sea, he had only condiments for nourishment, and he used a cloth to collect rainwater. He spent his time trying to keep water out of his sailboat and attempting to attract attention by lighting a fire, which failed.

“Twenty-four days — no land, nobody to talk to. Don’t know what to do, don’t know where you are. It was rough,” he said. “At a certain time, I lose hope. I think about my family.”

If someone is not laid back, that means they’re not super serious.

I was proud of myself for knowing the Chinese for engrave, so I said “go me”
	Congratulating myself!
	It means “I did it!”

I live in Cambodia. (柬埔寨)
I’ve been here for 3 years.
I’m an online English teacher, I mostly teach adults!
(teaching kids is sooooo boring!)

Dutiful
	Faithful 很专一

I am in Cambodia by chance!  I did not expect to end up here…it was completely by chance.  But it was a happy mistake!

Happy mistake
	Is a mistake/accident that ends up being positive.

Do not compare Cambodia and Shanghai
One is a very developed city
One is a very…developing country

Happy mistake (not real…just my word)
	You drop a bottle of paint on the ground…and it creates a beautiful design…that is a happy mistake



I lived in Shanghai (30 million) for 8 years.
I’ve lived in Phnom Penh (2 million)for 3 years.

Google Unveils [reveal a new product] Bard, Its ChatGPT Rival [对手]for AI-Powered Conversation

With a Microsoft event Tuesday expected to center on ChatGPT, the AI chatbot war is heating up.

Google on Monday released Bard, its own AI chatbot similar to ChatGPT, as the race to expand the use of artificial intelligence shifts into high gear.

“the race shifts into high gear” – the race is intensifying / the competition is getting more intense

"Bard seeks to combine the breadth [large amount; the whole amount] of the world's knowledge with the power, intelligence, and creativity of our large language models," Google Chief Executive Sundar Pichai tweeted Monday. "It draws on information [pulls information from] from the web to provide fresh, high-quality responses."


Bard is Google's response to the skyrocketing [increasing rapidly, 飙升吧]interest in AI chatbots thanks to the November release of ChatGPT, which has captured the imagination 【has many people interested in】 of millions of people due to its human-like responses and easy interface. Bard, ChatGPT and another AI chatbot developed by China's Baidu represent the next step in how we interact with AI and technology, potentially changing everything from search to education to work. 


Microsoft is hosting an event Tuesday where the company is expected discuss its own integration [combining two things] of OpenAI's ChatGPT into its Bing search engine.
	Integrating ChatGPT into the Bing search engine
Bing represents 9% of the world’s searches
Google represents 84% of the world’s searches





Google talked up its own system on Monday. 
	吹牛,夸大，宣扬, tout, brag about

‘talk up’
William’s mother really wanted the girl to like him, so she talked him up the whole night.

Bing is a Microsoft product



The power behind Bard is Google's Language Model for Dialogue Applications, aka LaMDA. 
Aka – also known as 又名

The company said its new AI will use information on the web to craft novel [new] responses -- creative, detailed or sometimes both -- to questions.

Novel (noun) – 小说
Novel (adj) – new 新颖的, 新奇的



Bard will be available Monday (2/13) to selected testers and then to the public in the coming weeks.

Bard吟游诗人– is a profession from a long time ago that no longer exists – it was a person who sang songs and told stories 
	(something from medieval times)

Shakespeare was referred to as “the bard”



Bard is based on a lightweight [fast, not using a lot of resources] version of LaMDA that uses less computing power, allowing it to scale to more people and provide additional feedback, according to a blog post by CEO Sundar Pichai. That feedback, Pichai said, will be critical to meeting Google's "high bar for quality, safety and groundedness in real-world information."

The goal is not to monetize [（通过网站访客）赚钱, to make money from] Bard at the moment, according to a Google spokesperson 发言人. The company didn't share details on ads or how Bard could be monetized in the future. The Google spokesperson said the company wants a healthy online ecosystem, and as it develops AI tools, sending search traffic to creators and news publishers will be a priority.

The ChatGPT angle

Don't expect Google rival Microsoft to stand still. On Tuesday, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella will announce "progress on a few exciting projects" at a press event at the company's headquarters, according to an invitation. Microsoft plans to integrate ChatGPT into its technology, and this event could be where details are announced.

•	Screenshots purporting 【to claim, not 100% factual necessarily】声称
 to show how Microsoft will integrate ChatGPT into Bing emerged in recent days. They indicated, among other things, that it will be based on OpenAI's GPT-4, a newer language model than the GPT-3.5 that ChatGPT currently uses. Microsoft didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.

ChatGPT uses artificial intelligence technology called a large language model, trained on vast swaths of data on the internet. That type of model uses an AI mechanism called a transformer that Google pioneered. ChatGPT's success across a range of activities -- writing software and passing exams to offering advice, in the style of the King James Bible, on how to remove a sandwich from a VCR -- has propelled it into the spotlight, even though its results can be misleading or wrong.

AI technology already is all around us, helping in everything from flagging credit card fraud to translating our speech into text messages. ChatGPT has elevated expectations, though, so it's clear the technology will become more important in our lives one way or another as we rely on digital assistants and online tools.

Google AI subsidiary DeepMind also is involved. Chief Executive Demis Hassabis told Time that his company is considering a 2023 private beta test of an AI chatbot called Sparrow.

In 2017, Google offered details on the transformers tech, and it's since become a fixture of some of the biggest AI systems out there. Nvidia's new H100 processor, the top dog in the world of AI acceleration at least in terms of public speed tests, now includes specific circuitry to accelerate transformers.

The large language model revolution in AI that resulted is useful for language-specific systems like ChatGPT, Google's LaMDA and newer PaLM, and others from companies including AI21 Labs, Adept AI Labs and Cohere. But large language models are used for other tasks, too, including stacking boxes and processing genetic data to hunt for new drugs. Notably, they're good at generating text, which is why they can be used for answering questions.

Google, which endured bad publicity over the departure of AI researcher Timnit Gebru in 2020, has a program focusing on responsible AI and machine learning, or ML, technology. "Building ML models and products in a responsible and ethical manner is both our core focus and core commitment," Google Research Vice President Marian Croak said in a January post.

Google is keen to tout its deep AI expertise. ChatGPT triggered a "code red" emergency within Google, according to The New York Times, and drew Google co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin back into active work.
