1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:02,830
HEY WELCOME TO THE END OF THE COURSE.

2
00:00:02,850 --> 00:00:03,290
YOU MADE IT.

3
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:03,750
YOU DID IT.

4
00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:05,520
CONGRATULATIONS YOU SHOULD BE.

5
00:00:05,550 --> 00:00:08,910
You should be proud that you were able to stick with the entire course.

6
00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:11,220
I realize it's very long.

7
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:17,400
Certainly and parts may maybe a little dry so I'm very pleased that you got through the course.

8
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:24,840
And I want to just thank you for taking the time to do it and I honestly hope that it was useful to

9
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:25,220
you.

10
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:30,170
I hope this course has been valuable and I hope it's something that you're glad that you did.

11
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:35,610
I really spent a lot of time and a lot of energy and put in a lot of thought and I hope that you were

12
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:42,570
able to feel that as you went through this course I have actually been working on this course for years.

13
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:46,250
So again genuinely great job and thank you very much.

14
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:52,470
And I want to just go over a couple of things a couple of recommendations I have things I hope you can

15
00:00:52,470 --> 00:00:59,820
keep in mind for how to improve your your English abilities going forward things to keep in mind in

16
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:02,430
your English learning journey.

17
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:05,970
Number one is the importance of review as you were going through the course.

18
00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:10,330
I hope that you took the time to take notes.

19
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:16,980
I hope that you took the time to seriously consider each each lesson and that you didn't just rush through

20
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:17,180
it.

21
00:01:17,690 --> 00:01:22,500
Now if you did that it's very important to review to keep all of those things fresh.

22
00:01:23,010 --> 00:01:29,130
If you just go through something once it can easily fade away so try to review the notes that you took.

23
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:33,970
And don't be afraid to actually go back and watch specific lessons if you need to.

24
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:40,880
In fact you might take a break and go through the entire course again if you're really really crazy.

25
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:44,340
I do that when I read a book I usually go back and read the whole book again.

26
00:01:44,370 --> 00:01:44,980
Why.

27
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:50,180
Because I want to make sure I didn't miss anything that maybe I didn't catch the first time through.

28
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:53,000
So don't be afraid to do that if you enjoyed the course.

29
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:59,130
It might be valuable to you to go back and actually go through the course again review your notes from

30
00:01:59,130 --> 00:01:59,960
time to time.

31
00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:05,760
And most importantly most importantly try to use the stuff that you learned in this course in your daily

32
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:06,500
life.

33
00:02:06,510 --> 00:02:11,850
I hope that everything you learn in this course is actually useful in real life.

34
00:02:11,850 --> 00:02:18,270
I was very careful to make sure all of the phrases and the different words we learned and all of the

35
00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:22,880
different skills that we learned in this course can actually be used in real life.

36
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:29,850
So I hope that you start using them because if you start using them in your conversations and situations

37
00:02:29,850 --> 00:02:35,670
that you encounter then you're going to remember more clearly all of those things and it's going to

38
00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:39,680
become part of your ability to communicate.

39
00:02:39,690 --> 00:02:46,590
So again review Don't be afraid to go back and re watch and certainly start using everything that you

40
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:51,210
learned as much as possible in your daily life.

41
00:02:51,210 --> 00:02:53,350
Number two is extremely important.

42
00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:59,940
And I mentioned it a lot and it's the reason why I always recommend that you record yourself when you're

43
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:07,440
speaking if you don't have others to practice with because awareness is really the key to moving forward

44
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:09,060
and building better habits.

45
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:11,400
I'll say it a thousand times if I need to.

46
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:13,860
It is the key to success.

47
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:18,780
If you don't know what you're saying and you're not aware of what you're saying then you're really never

48
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:20,370
going to sound more fluent.

49
00:03:20,370 --> 00:03:23,030
Now you might use the new words and phrases.

50
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:23,670
That's great.

51
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:26,430
And you're you're going to be able to handle more situations.

52
00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:27,580
That's wonderful.

53
00:03:27,630 --> 00:03:34,980
But you really need to develop a keen awareness of what is coming out of your own mouth in order to

54
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:39,060
become more fluent and to use the things that you learned in this course.

55
00:03:39,270 --> 00:03:43,410
Well and properly to actually take the next step.

56
00:03:43,410 --> 00:03:44,850
Awareness is key.

57
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:52,320
So do the exercises that we practiced in this course and also redo some of the things that are attached

58
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:59,970
to each lesson in the in the review part by practicing on a daily basis by giving yourself little tasks

59
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:03,780
and recording those tasks and then listening to them again.

60
00:04:03,930 --> 00:04:07,770
You're going to become more aware of what you say when you speak.

61
00:04:07,770 --> 00:04:13,320
You're going to be able to hear yourself better and the more you do that the better your habits will

62
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:20,580
be the stronger your good habits will be and the faster you'll be able to correct or to fix your bad

63
00:04:20,580 --> 00:04:21,360
habits.

64
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:28,440
So I hope that you continue to practice and I hope that you continue to record that practice so that

65
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:35,040
you can build that awareness so that you can then develop proper habits and get rid of the habits that

66
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:38,070
you don't like about your spoken English.

67
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:43,500
Finally I would encourage you if you're working on other aspects of your spoken English for example

68
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:47,360
pronunciation or how to think in English and other things.

69
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:54,390
I would encourage you to check out my other courses because they're really meant to focus on specific

70
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:58,600
areas of spoken English to help you improve in other ways.

71
00:04:58,710 --> 00:05:03,670
In addition to this worse those things can help you build out those good speaking habits.

72
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:10,090
I want to wish you the best of luck in your English language journey in the future and I hope to see

73
00:05:10,090 --> 00:05:11,920
you in another course.
