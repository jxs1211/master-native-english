00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:06,840
Hi there my name is Luke and welcome to the course I'm going to be the teacher for this entire course.

2
00:00:07,110 --> 00:00:14,070
And I want to in this first video this introduction just basically introduce a few things about the

3
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:21,930
structure the style of the course as well as share a few tips things I'd like you to keep in mind things

4
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:26,400
I'd like you to remember throughout the course as you go through it.

5
00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:29,660
Let's first just talk about the style of the course.

6
00:00:29,790 --> 00:00:32,590
Throughout this course for the entire course you're going to see me.

7
00:00:32,660 --> 00:00:33,650
Going to see my head.

8
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:36,150
See my face and see the blackboard.

9
00:00:36,150 --> 00:00:39,830
I'll be writing on the blackboard throughout the course.

10
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:45,690
There will be no lessons in which you'll see the board or a screen and not me.

11
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:48,320
There'll be no lessons in which you see me and not the board.

12
00:00:48,330 --> 00:00:53,580
We'll always be together me and my me and my best friend the blackboard.

13
00:00:53,580 --> 00:00:55,230
That's a heart that's bad.

14
00:00:55,230 --> 00:00:59,040
Speaking of a bad heart there will be times when my writing will be beat.

15
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:03,520
Maybe a little bit just a little bit messy because I'm writing quickly.

16
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:10,200
I think you will get used to how I write over time so if you find it difficult in the first or second

17
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:16,350
lesson to understand what I'm writing sometimes I think it'll get better.

18
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:22,800
After a couple more lessons because you have to get used to someone's writing style to be able to easily

19
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:28,920
read it and if I write very slowly then it will be extremely boring.

20
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:29,440
Right.

21
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:30,220
OK.

22
00:01:30,220 --> 00:01:34,380
Next let's talk about what we're going to learn in this course.

23
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:39,690
Well you can read through all of the lessons in the course and see what the contents are.

24
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:44,870
But I want to just say something about how I've decided to structure it.

25
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:47,820
That means how I've decided to organize it.

26
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:55,560
I've said before I've been working on this course for a very very long time years and I've organized

27
00:01:55,590 --> 00:02:02,700
the lessons in this course so that it's number one building upon things we learned previously that means

28
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:05,600
we learn something and then later on we'll use it.

29
00:02:05,730 --> 00:02:12,540
For example will learn about descriptions early in the course and then use those skills later on but

30
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:14,120
also to keep it interesting.

31
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:21,180
So we might do something social kind of fun like a situation that you'll encounter in daily life.

32
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:27,060
Lots of those and then we'll have something a little more technical such as a particular English skill

33
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:32,270
that you need to do a particular thing and then maybe the next one will be a little bit more fun.

34
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:38,040
And by doing that and having that variety I hope that the course will continue to be interesting and

35
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:39,630
continue to stay fresh.

36
00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:45,120
There will certainly be a couple of times when maybe a particular thing that we're learning is a bit

37
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:46,520
a bit dry.

38
00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:52,800
I try my best not to make it boring dry means boring although those skills are very important.

39
00:02:52,830 --> 00:02:59,880
Everything I've put into this course is important for people who want to improve their English.

40
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:06,840
If you're working on your spoken English even your written English this course will help you and everything

41
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:11,870
in this course is meant to be useful in your real life.

42
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:16,560
Just one more thing I want to mention before we talk about what to keep in mind throughout the course

43
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:21,000
and that is that I've broken lessons down into smaller parts.

44
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:24,290
If you have a long video that's 45 minutes long.

45
00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:27,730
It can be quite difficult to go through that whole thing.

46
00:03:27,810 --> 00:03:28,050
Right.

47
00:03:28,050 --> 00:03:31,430
It can be something that you might think about for a whole week.

48
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:34,700
Oh I have to do this 45 minute video right.

49
00:03:34,710 --> 00:03:42,210
It's like it's like needing to run up a big hill but if it's smaller if it's 10 minutes it's easier

50
00:03:42,210 --> 00:03:45,150
to digest the Hill is a little smaller.

51
00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:51,230
So even though it's part of a larger lesson each piece is easier to eat.

52
00:03:51,270 --> 00:03:53,280
Each Hill is smaller.

53
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:55,140
So that's why I've done that.

54
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:58,840
The lessons are broken up into smaller pieces.

55
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:04,680
Now things I'd like you to keep in mind throughout the course keep in mind means things to remember

56
00:04:04,950 --> 00:04:05,880
throughout the course.

57
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:09,370
Number one it's very important that you take notes.

58
00:04:09,450 --> 00:04:13,590
If you're sitting down at your computer if you're using your phone whatever.

59
00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:14,610
Take notes.

60
00:04:14,610 --> 00:04:16,800
If you take notes on your computer that's fine.

61
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:19,950
You want to take notes on a piece of paper or in a notebook.

62
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:20,520
That's fine.

63
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:27,780
I don't care but you want to take notes so that you're doing some action connected to what you're learning.

64
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:32,490
If you're only listening it may be hard to remember the things that you're learning.

65
00:04:32,490 --> 00:04:38,480
But if you have some action you're putting the things that you're learning into the real world.

66
00:04:38,610 --> 00:04:43,950
And by doing that the things that you're learning are going to stick more next.

67
00:04:44,070 --> 00:04:49,930
Don't hurry through this course if you rush through this course and try to finish it in several days.

68
00:04:49,950 --> 00:04:55,590
I think that you'll probably miss a lot of stuff unless you're a super genius and great at remembering

69
00:04:55,590 --> 00:04:57,170
every little thing you hear.

70
00:04:57,330 --> 00:05:03,210
I recommend that you take your time watch one video a day or one video every two days.

71
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:04,180
That's OK.

72
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:05,680
Don't rush through the course.

73
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:11,920
When you take your time you allow yourself time to practice what you've learned to review your notes

74
00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:17,160
and to just think about what you heard in the previous lesson.

75
00:05:17,290 --> 00:05:22,920
That time to think is as important as actually learning the stuff right.

76
00:05:22,930 --> 00:05:26,560
When you become a painter you paint and then you think oh I don't like this.

77
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:27,880
I could be better you go away.

78
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:30,280
You think about what you did and what you could do better.

79
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:33,190
You come back and then you paint better the next time.

80
00:05:33,190 --> 00:05:36,550
Well that's true for a lot of things and it's true for learning as well.

81
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:43,270
So I recommend that you have some space between each video so that you have time to review you have

82
00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:51,580
time to practice and you have time to reflect to reflect means to think walk around look at the clouds.

83
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:54,070
Have a cup of coffee whatever you need to do.

84
00:05:54,070 --> 00:05:54,540
OK.

85
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:55,810
Very important as well.

86
00:05:55,810 --> 00:05:57,530
Next you need to review.

87
00:05:57,640 --> 00:06:01,660
You've got a review with each lesson there's something you can practice.

88
00:06:01,690 --> 00:06:05,440
And I've attached basically an assignment to each lesson.

89
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:08,870
What you can do to practice what you've learned.

90
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:15,010
There's one really great way to practice English spoken English without actually talking with a friend.

91
00:06:15,010 --> 00:06:18,790
Now it's great if you can great if you have a teacher that's great.

92
00:06:18,790 --> 00:06:20,270
You have a friend you can talk with.

93
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:21,300
That's wonderful.

94
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:28,070
But if you want to practice the stuff that you've learned in each lesson by itself by yourself.

95
00:06:28,210 --> 00:06:35,500
Turn on your phone open the recording app or whatever you want to use and record the practice that is

96
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:36,340
sign.

97
00:06:36,430 --> 00:06:41,740
So by recording yourself you're you're doing what I mentioned earlier when you're taking notes you are

98
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:44,620
putting something out there you're making something.

99
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:49,920
Input output input output input an output go very well together.

100
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:55,790
When it comes to learning and recording is a great way to do output output.

101
00:06:56,020 --> 00:07:02,050
When it comes to learning languages when it comes to learning new spoken skills.

102
00:07:02,050 --> 00:07:08,010
Then if you feel like you didn't really get something go back and review watch a lesson twice.

103
00:07:08,010 --> 00:07:13,160
Watch a lesson three times if you need to when you finish this course go back and watch it again.

104
00:07:13,210 --> 00:07:20,250
Whenever I read a book I usually read that book twice that way I make sure I don't miss anything right.

105
00:07:20,290 --> 00:07:24,040
If I went through it once I might have missed a couple of small things.

106
00:07:24,070 --> 00:07:29,600
I go back I can catch those things that I might have missed the first time through.

107
00:07:29,650 --> 00:07:35,110
I want to just mention one thing that's very important and something I would like you to keep in mind

108
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:40,840
as you go through this course and that is the importance of awareness as you're practicing what you

109
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:41,470
learn.

110
00:07:41,530 --> 00:07:45,640
It's very important to be able to pay attention to what you're saying.

111
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:50,470
A lot of people when they're there speaking they don't pay attention to what sounds are coming out of

112
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:52,520
their own mouths.

113
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:56,570
Got to be able to pay attention to what you say.

114
00:07:56,740 --> 00:08:02,410
So that recording exercise is a great way to do that because you're catching things that you wouldn't

115
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:08,920
normally catch but then you can start to do that for yourself when you're speaking and that allows you

116
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:10,590
to build better habits.

117
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:17,440
So I hope you can as you go through this course pay very careful attention to not only the sounds that

118
00:08:17,470 --> 00:08:23,650
I'm making right and the way that I'm saying what I'm saying but also when you're practicing what you're

119
00:08:23,650 --> 00:08:29,380
saying and the sounds that you're making and how you're saying what you're saying it's very very important

120
00:08:29,390 --> 00:08:36,970
so develop your awareness and that is the key to the next step which is building better habits building

121
00:08:36,970 --> 00:08:43,360
better habits is the key to ultimately becoming a more natural English speaker.

122
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:48,910
Finally before we get started on the first lesson of this course I'd like you to remember to keep an

123
00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:56,590
open mind if there's something that you think is true about English maybe you learned that in school

124
00:08:56,590 --> 00:08:58,510
and it's not quite right.

125
00:08:58,510 --> 00:09:07,360
So be open minded maybe maybe a way that you've learned is either incorrect or correct and not natural

126
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:14,350
maybe native English speakers say something a different way even though that different way is not technically

127
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:15,580
correct.

128
00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:22,090
There are many examples of that in native spoken English and I will share some of those in this course.

129
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:22,520
OK.

130
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:28,750
So I'd like you to make a commitment to yourself to be open minded if you're close minded and you're

131
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:29,860
always saying well that can't be right.

132
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:30,460
That can't be right.

133
00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:31,290
That can't be right.

134
00:09:31,450 --> 00:09:33,960
Then you're not going to learn as much.

135
00:09:33,970 --> 00:09:41,200
So I encourage you to be more like a sponge a sponge absorbs things then the more you absorb you can

136
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:45,740
begin to process it and you can start using it in your daily life.

137
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:53,140
Learning English is all about ultimately really it's about learning to communicate with other people

138
00:09:53,230 --> 00:09:56,170
in writing or in conversation.

139
00:09:56,170 --> 00:10:02,980
And that's the main point of this course to give you the skills and the knowledge that you need to go

140
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:12,240
out into the world and use your language skills to communicate with people in a wide variety of situations.

141
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:19,720
This course will help you in many different areas improve your skills improve your knowledge and improve

142
00:10:19,990 --> 00:10:26,490
your ability to communicate in English with other people and without any more delay.

143
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:32,530
Let's go to the actual first lesson of the course and I want to just say that I hope you enjoy it.
