00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:07,740
Before we finish this lesson on our hotel booking dialogue what I'd like to do is just quickly share

2
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:12,130
with you a few ways to say goodbye formally and informally.

3
00:00:12,140 --> 00:00:15,960
So for a business one common thing to say is Thanks for coming.

4
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:17,250
Thanks for stopping by.

5
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:18,240
Thanks for calling.

6
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:19,460
Thank you for calling.

7
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:20,160
Thanks for coming.

8
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:24,630
If somebody comes over now it can be used informally as well.

9
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:29,010
If I go to your party and then it's time for me to leave you say OK well thanks for coming.

10
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:30,310
OK bye see you.

11
00:00:30,590 --> 00:00:31,090
OK.

12
00:00:31,110 --> 00:00:33,300
It's also quite common.

13
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:35,430
Have a nice one or have a good one.

14
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:36,450
Have a nice day.

15
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:38,190
These are also quite common.

16
00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:41,430
Have a Nice Day is for both friends.

17
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:46,270
Could say it and also people in the business could say it to people who are leaving.

18
00:00:46,290 --> 00:00:48,560
If you go to their shop then you leave.

19
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:49,980
They might say Have a nice day.

20
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:51,150
Have a good one.

21
00:00:51,150 --> 00:00:51,780
Same.

22
00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:53,760
I say this one to my friends all the time.

23
00:00:53,790 --> 00:00:54,740
All right have a good one.

24
00:00:54,740 --> 00:00:55,460
Bye.

25
00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:57,810
Sometimes I say both have a good one and goodbye.

26
00:00:57,830 --> 00:01:00,150
But you could just say Have a good one.

27
00:01:00,150 --> 00:01:01,290
Take care.

28
00:01:01,290 --> 00:01:01,830
Take care.

29
00:01:01,830 --> 00:01:03,240
Again this is for both.

30
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:08,610
But I also use it when I'm saying goodbye to my friends in person and over the phone.

31
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:10,700
Many of these can be used for both.

32
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:12,000
Thanks for stopping by.

33
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,200
Can be used for both.

34
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:14,280
Thanks for calling.

35
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:17,440
Maybe but it would be a very special situation.

36
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:20,910
That's informal where you would say thanks for calling with your friends.

37
00:01:20,910 --> 00:01:22,350
Thank you for calling friend.

38
00:01:22,390 --> 00:01:25,510
Sounds a little bit weird but man maybe maybe.

39
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:26,410
Thanks for calling.

40
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,070
I really needed to talk to you.

41
00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:29,130
That might work.

42
00:01:29,260 --> 00:01:29,880
OK.

43
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:32,580
See you later is always with friends.

44
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:37,600
OK if we're doing that as a business see later it's ok I guess it's all right.

45
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:42,810
If that's the way that you communicate but you're sort of communicating in a way as though you're that

46
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:48,990
person's friend and you wouldn't hear it in for example the the hotel dialogue situation they wouldn't

47
00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:49,860
say all right.

48
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:51,270
See you later.

49
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:53,760
That would be generally to relax.

50
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:58,350
That would be too informal and they might actually get in trouble for saying See you later.

51
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:04,860
Now this is very very informal and you wouldn't see this in any business will be very unlikely.

52
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:11,670
Maybe a skateboard shop where all of the people who work there are very relaxed the later but this is

53
00:02:11,850 --> 00:02:13,290
this is for friends only.

54
00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:15,660
And it just means goodbye just means goodbye.

55
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:16,560
Take it easy.

56
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:17,880
It's pretty informal.

57
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:18,750
Take it easy.

58
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:19,420
See you.

59
00:02:19,490 --> 00:02:26,970
You can say both or you can just say Take it easy used with friends typically stay warm and stay cool

60
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:29,540
are related to the context.

61
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:33,960
The actual weather if it's a hot day if it's summer to stay cool stay cool.

62
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:36,190
You want the person to feel comfortable.

63
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:36,720
Right.

64
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:38,450
So when you want them to feel comfortable.

65
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:40,530
If it's cold you want them to stay warm.

66
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:46,470
If it's warm you want them to stay cool so we can use either of these in context but usually only for

67
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:50,060
very warm days or very cold days if it's nice weather.

68
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:52,110
You probably wouldn't say either of these.

69
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:55,120
You might instead just say later See you later.

70
00:02:55,170 --> 00:03:01,550
One very traditional Goodbye is so long so long so long but I pretty much never use this one.

71
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:07,410
This one is becoming very very rare and I would recommend that you do not use that one.

72
00:03:07,410 --> 00:03:08,400
There are others too.

73
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:12,450
But these are some of the common ways to say goodbye both formally.

74
00:03:12,510 --> 00:03:19,910
For example if you are a front desk person or a receptionist in a hotel or if you're with friends.

75
00:03:19,910 --> 00:03:20,200
OK.

76
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:21,060
Very common.

77
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:26,970
So to practice this record the dialogue several times record yourself speaking through it.

78
00:03:26,970 --> 00:03:32,250
In both roles several times if you can get a friend involved that's great but make sure you recorded

79
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:36,650
on your phone for example so that you can listen to it again later.

80
00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:42,810
OK if you can then next time you're booking a hotel as I mentioned before try to do it over the phone.

81
00:03:42,810 --> 00:03:47,390
It's a great way to practice and you're going to put yourself in a feeling of pressure.

82
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:51,810
No no I don't know how to handle this and that's going to that discomfort is very healthy it's going

83
00:03:51,810 --> 00:03:54,320
to push you past your limitations.

84
00:03:54,330 --> 00:03:55,740
So I would encourage you to.

85
00:03:55,740 --> 00:04:02,480
Anytime you have the chance engage in real situations with real people especially customer service people.

86
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:08,160
Make sure to write down your questions before you call so that you don't have to try to remember them

87
00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:12,160
and that will make it a little bit easier you'll have a bit less pressure.

88
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:16,080
All right so good luck with that and I will see you in the next lesson.
