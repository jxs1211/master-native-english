1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:05,580
So we figured out the dates you've got the receptionist to understand when you want to stay how long

2
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:06,520
you want to stay.

3
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:07,810
How many people go.

4
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:10,740
Now we need to get into the different room types.

5
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:13,740
And there are many different room types for different hotels.

6
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:17,850
Obviously we can't cover all of them we're going to try to get into them a little bit.

7
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:18,660
Sure.

8
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:21,060
The last thing that was said was me and my wife.

9
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:21,550
Right.

10
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:22,170
Who's staying.

11
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:22,860
Me and my wife.

12
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:23,690
That's two people.

13
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:24,170
Sure.

14
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:26,180
This is just to acknowledge something.

15
00:00:26,190 --> 00:00:29,070
This is a very very useful word to say.

16
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:29,970
Yes.

17
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:33,630
Hey can I can I go I need to I need to finish something.

18
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:34,110
Yeah sure.

19
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:34,470
OK.

20
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:37,090
Or to confirm that you've got information.

21
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:37,780
OK.

22
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:40,580
I have to leave tomorrow at 3:00 p.m..

23
00:00:40,630 --> 00:00:41,030
OK.

24
00:00:41,050 --> 00:00:42,350
Sure sure.

25
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:43,930
That could mean I understand.

26
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:44,360
Yes.

27
00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:48,060
Or it could also mean I recognize that you said that I understand.

28
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:51,650
And if you tell me that tomorrow I will remember it probably.

29
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:51,890
All right.

30
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:52,290
Sure.

31
00:00:52,290 --> 00:00:54,140
And which room type would you like.

32
00:00:54,150 --> 00:00:56,160
Which room type would you like.

33
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:58,890
Could you tell me more about your room types.

34
00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:01,620
Maybe I've never stayed at the villa hotel before.

35
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:03,190
So I need to know more.

36
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:09,960
We have a standard room standard is often described as the basic option of something the basic option.

37
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:15,470
So if you get a car with standard features that means it doesn't have anything extra.

38
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:17,270
It's kind of the basic thing.

39
00:01:17,370 --> 00:01:24,720
And there's nothing about it that's maybe premium premium premium has that's an IOU and premium has

40
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:29,030
lots of extra things with a standard room which has two double beds two double beds.

41
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:31,890
That's one hundred and twenty seven dollars per night.

42
00:01:31,980 --> 00:01:32,510
OK.

43
00:01:32,590 --> 00:01:36,180
Notice that when we read this we don't say dollar 127.

44
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:42,450
We say one hundred and twenty seven and then we say dollars OK even though it's before even though the

45
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:44,160
dollar sign is before.

46
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:46,170
That's one hundred and twenty seven dollars per night.

47
00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:54,180
Then we also have a queen room which is 140 but the room is the same size to the Queen room has a queen

48
00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:55,010
bed.

49
00:01:55,140 --> 00:02:00,280
The bed size is Queen general sizes for beds in hotels are double.

50
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:07,590
And then Queen and then King and this is in order of size sometimes you'll see a twin bed twin is generally

51
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:08,120
smaller.

52
00:02:08,130 --> 00:02:12,560
So twin is one person but you don't usually see that in a hotel.

53
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:15,160
You'll see double queen and king.

54
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:15,640
OK.

55
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:22,320
So the next one but the room is the same size the deluxe room deluxe is a word that's used to describe

56
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:28,230
something that does have extra sometimes premium things added onto it.

57
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:35,310
If you go to a fast food restaurant and you get something that has extra it's often a deluxe.

58
00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:36,870
For example a deluxe burger.

59
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:43,020
There are extra things on the burger the deluxe room has a king bed and the room is bigger.

60
00:02:43,170 --> 00:02:45,210
That's one hundred and eighty dollars.

61
00:02:45,210 --> 00:02:50,320
Notice I say a hundred and eighty dollars not one hundred and eighty.

62
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:57,250
You don't have to say one we often say oh if it's anything that is one an hour a day a year a month.

63
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:58,250
A hundred.

64
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:05,580
That's one hundred and eighty dollars per night then of course we have the suite which has a separate

65
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:12,990
bedroom a big balcony and a Jacuzzi a balcony is basically an outside an outdoor area.

66
00:03:12,990 --> 00:03:17,470
Building is here and then there's a balcony that comes out like that.

67
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:18,660
It's a very ugly balcony.

68
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:20,260
And not every hotel room has one.

69
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:25,980
So that's a nice that's a kind of a deluxe thing right suite room is usually the nicest room in the

70
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:28,020
hotel and a Jacuzzi.

71
00:03:28,050 --> 00:03:33,030
Wow a Jacuzzi is often called a hot tub hot tub.

72
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:35,640
And this is kind of like a a bathtub.

73
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:42,660
But it's more a public thing that multiple people can share and it's not actually for bathing it's for

74
00:03:42,690 --> 00:03:43,750
relaxation.

75
00:03:43,770 --> 00:03:45,140
And it bubbles it's hot.

76
00:03:45,170 --> 00:03:46,770
It's got jets of water.

77
00:03:46,770 --> 00:03:50,080
It's called a Jacuzzi or a hot tub.

78
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:51,810
So this is a very nice room.

79
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:52,300
OK.

80
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,940
Now we have to decide which of these rooms we want.

81
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:57,510
We have the standard which is the basic.

82
00:03:57,510 --> 00:03:59,380
We have the Queen.

83
00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:03,820
We have the deluxe and we also have the suite room.

84
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,100
Which one are we going to pick.
