1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:05,800
So far in our hotel dialogue we've been able to confirm the dates.

2
00:00:05,850 --> 00:00:10,440
We've also been able to confirm the number of guests and we've talked about the different room types

3
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:11,370
and the prices.

4
00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:17,430
So now it's time to decide before we decide where the guest before we decide which room type we might

5
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:21,640
want to know how much the suite room is probably pretty expensive.

6
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:25,800
It's three hundred and twenty dollars per night each night.

7
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:27,000
Three hundred and twenty.

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:35,100
Well that's pretty expensive and maybe that's a bit out of my price range.

9
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:37,150
It's a bit out of my price range.

10
00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:37,860
All right.

11
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:40,770
Now I've tried to make this as natural as possible.

12
00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:45,750
I've tried to make it as realistic as possible so by adding things like Mm hmm.

13
00:00:45,810 --> 00:00:46,510
All right.

14
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:52,020
It's not really adding a lot of meaning but it is adding what people often say when they're in this

15
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:58,290
kind of conversation is what we use when we think all right is when we've decided something or when

16
00:00:58,290 --> 00:00:59,660
we've agreed to something.

17
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:01,620
All right I guess I guess.

18
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:04,260
And again this doesn't really add anything either.

19
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:11,700
We often just add I guess to things to soften what we're saying or when we're not really sure we're

20
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:13,950
not really confident about what we want to say.

21
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:15,110
I guess I'll have.

22
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:16,770
Well I guess I'll have a burger.

23
00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:17,690
You're not really sure.

24
00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:22,120
So I guess we'll go with go with means choose choose.

25
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:27,270
I guess we'll go with the deluxe room as long as it has Wi-Fi.

26
00:01:27,690 --> 00:01:34,350
So there is a now condition a condition if it has Wi-Fi I'll stay there if it doesn't I won't.

27
00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:35,670
Of course it has Wi-Fi.

28
00:01:35,730 --> 00:01:37,150
It's the 21st century.

29
00:01:37,150 --> 00:01:38,500
It's got to have Wi-Fi.

30
00:01:38,580 --> 00:01:41,040
Could we get it higher up the Wi-Fi.

31
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:42,700
No we're talking about the room.

32
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:45,370
We could say could we get a room that's higher up.

33
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:49,210
Could we get a room in an upper floor an upper floor.

34
00:01:49,230 --> 00:01:51,840
We could say that too but could we get it higher up.

35
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:52,800
They will know what we mean.

36
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:54,060
We want a view.

37
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:54,840
We want a view.

38
00:01:54,870 --> 00:01:57,300
We want a room with a view if possible.

39
00:01:57,300 --> 00:02:04,590
Now that's just a preference a preference is when maybe we have three choices A B and C but I RIGHT

40
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:13,770
SEE THERE A B and C and A is the preference but B is OK to maybe C is OK but a is our preference so

41
00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:21,050
if there are two rooms one on the tenth floor and the one on the 30th floor they're both deluxe rooms.

42
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:22,260
They both have Wi-Fi.

43
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:23,640
They're the same price.

44
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:29,520
Well I'm gonna choose my preference would be to have the one on the higher floor not the one on the

45
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:30,270
lower floor.

46
00:02:30,290 --> 00:02:30,670
OK.

47
00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:32,000
It's just a preference.

48
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:36,890
I'll take either one if I have to but that one is better because I like the view OK.

49
00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:40,620
So we use if possible when we want to state our preferences.

50
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:41,220
Sure.

51
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:48,450
I can book a deluxe room on the 24th floor if that works and yes it does have Wi-Fi.

52
00:02:48,510 --> 00:02:49,830
It does have Wi-Fi.

53
00:02:49,890 --> 00:02:51,620
So we're doing all that together.

54
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:56,700
And I realized I forgot to mark who's saying what I think you can guess here but let's just do that.

55
00:02:56,730 --> 00:02:59,130
How much is the how much is the suite.

56
00:02:59,130 --> 00:03:01,020
This is said by the guest.

57
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,960
It's three hundred and twenty dollars per night.

58
00:03:02,970 --> 00:03:04,760
That is the receptionist.

59
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:05,250
All right.

60
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:06,200
That's the guest.

61
00:03:06,450 --> 00:03:09,540
And then the receptionist is confirming.

62
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:13,340
Sure means that's OK I can book the book.

63
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:21,090
That means there are probably several rooms on maybe the 24th floor or on higher floors on the 24th

64
00:03:21,090 --> 00:03:21,360
floor.

65
00:03:21,390 --> 00:03:25,400
If that works and yes it does have Wi-Fi.

66
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:28,880
Do you have any questions that means about other things.

67
00:03:28,890 --> 00:03:31,010
For example we've got the room now.

68
00:03:31,170 --> 00:03:31,780
It's set.

69
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:32,910
It's all good.

70
00:03:32,910 --> 00:03:34,260
I've got your preferences.

71
00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:35,780
I've booked the room that you want.

72
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:37,080
It's on the 24th floor.

73
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:38,220
That's pretty good.

74
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:39,870
Sure confirms it.

75
00:03:40,230 --> 00:03:47,020
And then if that works is to say if you have any problems with me doing this I'm doing it now.

76
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:48,830
The receptionist is doing it now.

77
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:52,450
If there are any issues with me doing that now say it now.

78
00:03:52,530 --> 00:03:53,220
Say wait wait wait.

79
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:53,810
No no no.

80
00:03:53,820 --> 00:04:00,490
The 20 Twenty fourth floor is not high enough for example but it saves time.

81
00:04:00,570 --> 00:04:06,690
We can get through the interaction faster if I don't need to say is that OK because you've told me that

82
00:04:06,690 --> 00:04:11,970
you want a deluxe room on the 24th floor or a higher floor so I can assume that what I'm going to do

83
00:04:11,970 --> 00:04:13,460
now is OK.

84
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:14,030
OK.

85
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:15,470
And yes it does have Wi-Fi.

86
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:16,920
Do you have any questions.

87
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:22,990
It's a very common question to ask to make sure that all of the needs of the guest are met.

88
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:30,210
If you're not really confident in your English and you're in this situation one good idea might be to

89
00:04:30,210 --> 00:04:33,180
write down your questions before you call.

90
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:39,360
That way you can focus on being polite and getting the really important things correct like the type

91
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:40,800
of room and the dates.

92
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:43,530
And then you don't have to try to remember your questions.

93
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:48,870
If you if you don't feel very confident to to do the English situation if you need to do this.

94
00:04:48,870 --> 00:04:50,280
Write your questions down.

95
00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:51,220
That's my advice.

96
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:53,370
That's just personal personal advice.
