1
00:00:04,020 --> 00:00:10,260
In the last lesson we focused on common situations and expressions we can use in those situations.

2
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:17,430
In this lesson we're going to talk about how to book a hotel room and we're going to do it as a phone

3
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:18,000
call.

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,760
Now I realize that most of the time when you need to book a hotel room you can do it online.

5
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:27,730
I understand that but I believe that it's important to know how to do it.

6
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:34,620
If you need to and through the exercise of learning how to do it will also come across a lot of the

7
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:42,030
useful vocabulary related to hotels and customer service that you can use in lots of other situations

8
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:44,800
lots of other cases as well.

9
00:00:44,810 --> 00:00:45,070
OK.

10
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:51,480
So hopefully by getting the feeling for this you'll have a better feeling for dealing with customer

11
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:58,220
service people and also have a deeper understanding of hotel related words and phrases.

12
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:01,930
So we're actually going to go through this as a dialogue.

13
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:08,760
I basically written a dialogue and we're going to go through it line by line and we'll also talk about

14
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:13,950
some of the alternative phrases that can be used instead of the lines that we're we're going through.

15
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:18,750
So let's get started with our hotel booking situation.
