1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:03,000
OK so let's get started with the dialogue.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,160
One person the guest I've written here.

3
00:00:06,170 --> 00:00:07,980
Gee that stands for.

4
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:13,380
Guest is calling the vault the anvil hotel.

5
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:14,770
I don't think that's a real hotel.

6
00:00:14,770 --> 00:00:16,370
I've I've used this word.

7
00:00:16,380 --> 00:00:18,180
It means something completely different.

8
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:21,320
But it's a funny word I enjoy I enjoy the sound of it.

9
00:00:21,350 --> 00:00:24,040
So I've decided to make up a hotel called the envelop.

10
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:27,720
If there's really a hotel called the anvil effect it's very cool.

11
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:30,750
And then this one are will be our receptionist.

12
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:36,090
Now the receptionist is the person who works at the often the front desk of the hotel.

13
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:42,200
This person is sometimes called the front desk person so they could be called a receptionist.

14
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:44,380
They could be called a front desk person.

15
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:50,000
Sometimes this person is called up a clerk but usually front desk person and receptionist.

16
00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:51,290
We have our receptionist.

17
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:54,230
We have our guest and this is the very beginning.

18
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:57,420
This is how the receptionist may answer the phone.

19
00:00:57,420 --> 00:00:57,680
Hello.

20
00:00:57,690 --> 00:01:00,450
Thank you for calling the vault boom vault hotel.

21
00:01:00,450 --> 00:01:01,440
My name is Luke.

22
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:02,520
How may I help you.

23
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:08,880
This is a very common beginning to any sort of service phone call anytime you call a company and a customer

24
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:10,090
service person answers.

25
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:13,650
They'll probably say how may I help you.

26
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:14,730
How can I help you.

27
00:01:14,830 --> 00:01:18,410
OK yeah hello I'm calling to book a room.

28
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:18,840
OK.

29
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:20,440
Can we say reserve a room.

30
00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:22,260
Can we say make a reservation.

31
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:23,380
Yeah I suppose you can.

32
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:26,010
You could say reserve a room.

33
00:01:26,010 --> 00:01:34,740
Book a room make a reservation however book a room is generally the most common way to express the idea

34
00:01:35,370 --> 00:01:36,730
of doing it in advance.

35
00:01:36,730 --> 00:01:40,850
Now the most important information is usually not your personal information.

36
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:44,430
At the beginning that's actually not so important right from the start.

37
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:49,470
So you don't always have to say your name at the beginning because they're probably the receptionist

38
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:56,310
is probably not writing it down but you should give them the details of the reservation the details

39
00:01:56,310 --> 00:01:57,250
of the booking.

40
00:01:57,250 --> 00:01:57,760
OK.

41
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:01,810
Most important is generally the dates you want to book.

42
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:02,180
OK.

43
00:02:02,190 --> 00:02:05,220
So they'll probably ask which dates would you like to book.

44
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:08,620
Now this person could say the guests could say yeah hello.

45
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:14,450
They don't have to say yeah you could say hello or you could say hi hi I'm calling to book a room when

46
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:16,320
we want to say our purpose in calling.

47
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:20,290
I'm calling to I'm calling to is very very common.

48
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:23,470
Any type of situation where you want to get something done.

49
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:26,820
You could say I'm calling to book a room from the.

50
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:32,550
And you could say this one and then they're not asking but generally they will ask so that you know

51
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:37,290
that they're ready to hear what you're going to say the dates you're going to say they might not be

52
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:37,620
ready.

53
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:40,790
So it's a good idea to just say one step at a time.

54
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:45,690
One thing you should not do in this sort of situation is say all of the details together.

55
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:51,900
Yes I'd like to book a room between the 18th and the 22nd and I'd like it to be on the 22nd floor and

56
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:55,540
I want blah blah blah and my name is blah blah blah my phone number is blah.

57
00:02:55,650 --> 00:02:56,470
Don't do that.

58
00:02:56,490 --> 00:02:59,640
Do you think they're writing down everything very quickly.

59
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:00,350
No.

60
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:01,890
One step at a time.

61
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:03,660
Follow their pace.

62
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:09,750
Wait for them the receptionist or the person on the other end who is going to be putting your information

63
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:10,770
in the system.

64
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:14,240
Wait for them to ask the question because they need to be ready.

65
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:15,490
You know what you want.

66
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:15,910
OK.

67
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:16,740
Which dates.

68
00:03:16,770 --> 00:03:18,490
Which dates would you like to book.

69
00:03:18,570 --> 00:03:19,050
Now.

70
00:03:19,170 --> 00:03:25,080
Sometimes they'll say how many nights how many nights.

71
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:30,830
So sometimes when we're booking a hotel instead of dates we use nights because you're staying overnight.

72
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:35,730
We don't say days because actually the most important thing that they need to know is the number of

73
00:03:35,730 --> 00:03:41,700
nights because you're checking out on the last one but you're not staying for that night.

74
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:48,330
So for example if you want to stay three nights the twenty third the 24th and the 25th that's the night

75
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:49,730
of the 25th.

76
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:50,030
OK.

77
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:53,130
So you're going to check out on the twenty sixth.

78
00:03:53,550 --> 00:03:54,010
So you're staying.

79
00:03:54,010 --> 00:03:58,430
Twenty third 24th 25th checking out on the twenty sixth.

80
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:00,180
You're leaving on the 26.

81
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:02,710
You're not staying the night of the twenty sixth.

82
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:06,980
If that makes sense you're always checking out on the following day.

83
00:04:06,990 --> 00:04:11,430
That's why it's more clear to use nights when you're talking about a hotel.

84
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:11,760
OK.

85
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:18,000
Now could we do what we learned before in our technical descriptions class where we say between the

86
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,230
20 or between the 18th and the 22nd.

87
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:21,860
Yeah yeah.

88
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:22,530
You can do that.

89
00:04:22,530 --> 00:04:25,470
You could say between the 18th and the 22nd.

90
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:25,740
OK.

91
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:28,520
So generally that's how we'll do the beginning of the call.

92
00:04:28,530 --> 00:04:32,490
They might start with the room type but we'll go to the room type next.

93
00:04:32,550 --> 00:04:34,430
So it could could be a different order.

94
00:04:34,430 --> 00:04:38,960
It doesn't have to be this order but generally they want to know when you're going to stay.

95
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,060
And sometimes they want some clarification.

96
00:04:41,070 --> 00:04:42,710
So we'll talk about that too.
