1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:03,500
We've reached the end of the dialogue.

2
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:09,570
Hopefully you've learned a lot about how different things are described in hotels.

3
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:12,930
And if you need to how to actually make a booking.

4
00:00:12,930 --> 00:00:19,200
Now at the end it's the job of the receptionist to confirm to confirm the booking all the details just

5
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:21,130
to make sure it's all right.

6
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:26,700
OK now we did a confirmation before when we were talking about inviting a friend to do something.

7
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:28,710
The person who calls needs to confirm.

8
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:33,570
Well in this case it's the business that needs to confirm because they're the ones who are going to

9
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:35,010
provide the service.

10
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:37,140
They're the ones who are going to take your money.

11
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:37,440
Right.

12
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:42,840
So they should confirm but we confirm in the same way we always confirm with the words so and it's so

13
00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:44,480
easy to confirm things.

14
00:00:44,490 --> 00:00:48,140
So then you just say the basic details you're all set.

15
00:00:48,150 --> 00:00:56,360
All set means nothing more needs to be done nothing more needs to be done.

16
00:00:56,400 --> 00:01:03,660
You're all set with five nights in the deluxe could say deluxe room from the 18th checking out on the

17
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:04,770
twenty third.

18
00:01:04,770 --> 00:01:05,840
Thank you so much.

19
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:06,270
OK.

20
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:10,740
Now if somebody says all set they might be answering the question.

21
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:12,500
Do I need to do anything else.

22
00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:18,940
If you buy something if you want to maybe refund something or whatever you can ask them.

23
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:20,220
A customer service person.

24
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:21,960
What else do I need to do.

25
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:23,250
Do you need my card.

26
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:23,820
What.

27
00:01:23,830 --> 00:01:24,740
No you're all set.

28
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:25,410
You're all set.

29
00:01:25,410 --> 00:01:27,780
Means nothing else needs to happen.

30
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:28,850
Go go go.

31
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:29,640
You're finished.

32
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:31,460
Have a nice day.

33
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:32,260
Very very common.

34
00:01:32,350 --> 00:01:32,660
OK.

35
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:35,430
We look forward to seeing you on the 18th.

36
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:37,460
And thanks for booking with us.

37
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:38,640
Have a great day.

38
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,160
Now why use us.

39
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:42,100
Why use we.

40
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:50,040
Well because this is just one person representing the organization the hotel and so if they say I look

41
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:54,040
forward to seeing you it feels like you're the only person who works here.

42
00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:55,790
You're gonna be here when I come.

43
00:01:55,790 --> 00:01:56,640
How do I know that.

44
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,090
How do you know that.

45
00:01:58,380 --> 00:01:58,820
Right.

46
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:00,890
So it's actually very professional to use.

47
00:02:00,890 --> 00:02:08,220
We look forward to and us when it's a situation where there's not a personal relationship between the

48
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:10,540
person who called and the receptionist.

49
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:14,100
It's a relationship between the business and the person who called.

50
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:20,940
So if it's that sort of relationship we means anybody who's working here when you check in it's going

51
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:24,180
to be the person who sees you on the 18th.

52
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:24,390
Right.

53
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:25,680
So that's why we use we.

54
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:31,680
That's why we use us when you're talking about your company that you represent and you're just one person

55
00:02:32,010 --> 00:02:37,050
and maybe you're going to have a day off when this person actually comes to the hotel and maybe also

56
00:02:37,050 --> 00:02:42,220
when they check out or maybe today's your last day of work and you're never coming back here again.

57
00:02:42,270 --> 00:02:45,780
Well that's why it's best to use we look forward to seeing you.

58
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:47,590
Thank you for booking Have a nice day.

59
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:47,950
All right.

60
00:02:47,970 --> 00:02:51,140
Thank you so much as a very polite way to say thank you.

61
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:56,390
That's a little bit formal but it's very common for service related situations.

62
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,290
So that's it for our dialogue.

63
00:02:58,290 --> 00:03:03,830
We are going to go on though and I'm going to show you just a couple other ways we can say goodbye.

64
00:03:03,930 --> 00:03:05,130
Just so you know OK.

65
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:12,120
But I hope that you feel comfortable now to call the hotel and make a booking and I would encourage

66
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:19,020
you next time you want to book a hotel instead of doing it on a Web site or an app try to call challenge

67
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:19,460
yourself.
