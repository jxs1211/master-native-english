1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:08,760
So far in our hotel dialogue we've finalized the number of guests dates room type any preferences and

2
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:10,330
answered any questions.

3
00:00:10,340 --> 00:00:16,770
OK now we need to get down to the personal information because that's what's needed in order to make

4
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:23,710
the booking actually put it into the system so that when you arrive here able to actually check in check

5
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:26,000
in is what you do when you get to the hotel.

6
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:31,380
The reason you usually don't do that at the very beginning is because they're probably not ready to

7
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:32,840
write down that information.

8
00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:36,030
So generally they will ask that toward the end.

9
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:42,360
Different places are different but I used to actually do this job it was one of my first jobs and I

10
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:48,190
had to take reservations over the phone very often take bookings over the phone every day.

11
00:00:48,330 --> 00:00:50,700
And this is how it went step by step.

12
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:55,170
We had a step guide that we had to follow as receptionists.

13
00:00:55,170 --> 00:01:00,420
Anyway let me just get your personal information so I can finalize the booking.

14
00:01:00,450 --> 00:01:05,880
So I've got everything down but I need to connect it to something so that we can maybe call you if there

15
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:10,630
are any problems or charge you if you don't show up for example for the first night.

16
00:01:11,150 --> 00:01:19,050
OK let me get let me get could also say just like we're ordering in a restaurant could I have could

17
00:01:19,050 --> 00:01:20,250
I have.

18
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:20,980
That's fine too.

19
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:26,460
Let me get your personal information so I can finalize finalized means to make something final.

20
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:33,900
It's a verb form any sort of process that has steps and then you want to make sure these steps are finished.

21
00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:37,920
We could say we should finalize this before we go on to the next thing.

22
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,020
Let's finalize it.

23
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:39,920
Very useful verb.

24
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:43,680
OK let me just get your personal information so I can finalize the booking.

25
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:47,330
Could I have your full name and phone number now.

26
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:56,430
Full name is generally first name middle name last name in English the last name is the family name

27
00:01:56,460 --> 00:02:04,140
first name is the given name and the middle name is also given names who have family name and a given

28
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:07,080
name given name is the one that is given to you.

29
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:10,680
Family name is the one that you get because of your family.

30
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:15,570
So my family name is pretty and my given name is Luke.

31
00:02:15,730 --> 00:02:16,110
Ok.

32
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:16,500
Sure.

33
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:17,250
That means all right.

34
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:18,480
No problem.

35
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:19,680
It's Luke pretty.

36
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:22,020
Now most people know how to spell Luke.

37
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:29,550
Generally it's either spelled l UK E or L you see if I have a French accent maybe I have to spell it

38
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:36,060
l you c and because that's how it's sometimes spelled in France but because I have an American accent

39
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:41,220
they will write down probably l U.K. e because that's how it's spelled in America typically.

40
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:41,490
OK.

41
00:02:41,970 --> 00:02:43,230
So last name.

42
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:45,060
Last name my last name is weird.

43
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:49,830
I need to spell that because a lot of people think my last name is pretty.

44
00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:51,490
Actually it's PR I d d y.

45
00:02:51,510 --> 00:02:56,620
But if you say it pretty pretty pretty it's pretty much the same pronunciation as pretty.

46
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:01,020
Because when we say pretty actually we usually say that as a light D.

47
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:03,660
Pretty pretty pretty basically exactly the same.

48
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:04,270
OK.

49
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:08,760
So I need to be very careful and I need to spell out each letter.

50
00:03:08,910 --> 00:03:15,300
And when you want to do that over the phone does it add it it added that it added a you will spell out

51
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:20,460
the letter say the letter and then another word that starts with the same letter just so it can't be

52
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:21,370
confused.

53
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:27,300
Can we do that with as in this is the phrase we use as in OK.

54
00:03:27,410 --> 00:03:27,900
Sure.

55
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:35,040
It's loop pretty last name P as in Penguin pup of a penguin are as in Rhino.

56
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:42,750
I as in India d as In dog D as in dog you only use the same one if it's two letters that are the same

57
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:49,860
y as in yellow the phone number is 4 1 9 7 5 2 7 3 8 3.

58
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:54,230
And again I could write that with the parentheses around it like that.

59
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:56,620
OK let me repeat the number back to you.

60
00:03:56,670 --> 00:04:00,070
We should we should do these gotta write the rolls again.

61
00:04:00,090 --> 00:04:07,230
Receptionist guest receptionist guest all right.

62
00:04:07,230 --> 00:04:10,290
So the receptionist says Let me repeat the number back to you.

63
00:04:10,290 --> 00:04:17,200
Now there's going to be a mistake for 1 9 7 5 3 7 3 8 3 OK.

64
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:18,350
So it's actually 2.

65
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:24,840
Right now if somebody gets a number wrong and you want to correct them don't say the whole number again.

66
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:29,340
If you say no no no it's 4 1 9 7 5 2 7 3 8 3.

67
00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:36,120
You say the whole thing again you're going to get into a situation where they're confused they're confused

68
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:37,890
about which one was wrong.

69
00:04:37,890 --> 00:04:43,710
It's it's difficult because it's on the phone being on the phone with someone can be confusing.

70
00:04:43,710 --> 00:04:48,600
For example hearing pretty and pretty pretty and pretty can be very difficult right.

71
00:04:48,630 --> 00:04:53,150
So that's why we use this as in sort of structure to clarify it.

72
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:59,340
And then when we have a mistake with numbers we use when we want to correct something only three numbers

73
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:00,450
not the whole thing.

74
00:05:00,510 --> 00:05:05,130
You can use the wrong number in the middle or the wrong number at the end or at the beginning but you

75
00:05:05,130 --> 00:05:07,640
need to stress it stressed the wrong number.

76
00:05:07,650 --> 00:05:13,470
And then the right number and the other two should be unstressed unstressed like this.

77
00:05:13,590 --> 00:05:23,800
No sorry not 7 5 3 it's 7 5 2 No sorry not 7 5 3 it's 7 5 2.

78
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:25,850
That means all of the other numbers are correct.

79
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:27,570
You don't need to change them.

80
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:28,280
OK.

81
00:05:28,290 --> 00:05:28,680
Got it.

82
00:05:28,770 --> 00:05:28,970
OK.

83
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:29,550
I see.

84
00:05:29,550 --> 00:05:30,120
I see.

85
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:32,010
So that's how we do that on the phone.

86
00:05:32,010 --> 00:05:36,810
This is a way to clarify when a mistake has been made.

87
00:05:36,810 --> 00:05:43,770
And another very important thing is when you're dealing with Americans don't use for example double

88
00:05:43,950 --> 00:05:47,820
double to double six triple three.

89
00:05:47,850 --> 00:05:48,650
Don't do that.

90
00:05:48,810 --> 00:05:55,800
Don't do that you will confuse American English speakers a great deal avoid it just say the number one

91
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:57,990
by one one by one.

92
00:05:58,110 --> 00:06:00,400
OK so let's move on.

93
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:01,700
The receptionist says.

94
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:03,900
Got it means I understand the number.

95
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:05,340
I've got all that information.

96
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:14,190
Got your name and I need your credit card information or credit card number to hold the room hold the

97
00:06:14,190 --> 00:06:14,610
room.

98
00:06:14,610 --> 00:06:16,770
That's the purpose of a booking.

99
00:06:16,830 --> 00:06:24,300
It needs to be held usually hotels have the policy of charging you for the first night not all the nights

100
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:25,430
but the first night.

101
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:33,000
If you don't show up if you make the booking and then you don't cancel 24 hours before then they're

102
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,480
going to charge you for the whole first night.

103
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:37,870
Sort of as a punishment or a fee.

104
00:06:37,890 --> 00:06:38,930
Sure it's.

105
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:40,380
And then you say the number.

106
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:42,770
And what's the expiration date.

107
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:44,150
It's done Ed..

108
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:47,540
And the code on the back it's OK.

109
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:48,950
So there's that code on the back.

110
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:55,680
There's the expiration date when you want to say that very simply just use it or it is very very basic

111
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:56,240
stuff.

112
00:06:56,340 --> 00:07:02,430
But they will usually get those three details from you your name your phone number sometimes your email

113
00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:09,990
address to send you maybe a confirmation confirmation and they will also get your credit card info in

114
00:07:09,990 --> 00:07:13,220
case you don't show up and they need to charge you.

115
00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:18,930
They need to reserve it for you so that they don't lose a bunch of money not being able to put other

116
00:07:18,930 --> 00:07:21,360
people in a room where nobody is going to stay.
