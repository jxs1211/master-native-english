1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:05,700
All right so let's continue with our dialogue and we're going to get a little bit more into the actual

2
00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:08,310
dates the nights that we're staying.

3
00:00:08,310 --> 00:00:12,880
I'm going to start with the previous line that we talked about from the 18th to the 22nd.

4
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:17,370
So the receptionist will often try to confirm information to be very clear.

5
00:00:17,370 --> 00:00:19,350
So there are no misunderstandings.

6
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:23,730
So four nights just to confirm is that right.

7
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:27,450
So anytime you want to confirm information we often say is that right.

8
00:00:27,450 --> 00:00:29,850
You first say the detail and then you say is that right.

9
00:00:29,850 --> 00:00:30,750
So you want 30.

10
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:31,830
Is that right.

11
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:32,700
Is that right.

12
00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:35,710
The very useful way to confirm information.

13
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:36,200
OK.

14
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:40,420
Checking out on the 22nd checking out on the 22nd.

15
00:00:40,470 --> 00:00:41,490
No sorry.

16
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:45,150
Five nights checking out on the twenty third.

17
00:00:45,150 --> 00:00:51,360
So it's important to get clarification because sometimes the guest may be confused about as I talked

18
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:53,790
about the difference between days and nights.

19
00:00:53,790 --> 00:00:55,240
It can be a little confusing.

20
00:00:55,320 --> 00:01:04,110
So 18th 19th 20th 21st 22nd five nights checking out on the twenty third.

21
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:09,300
Not staying the night of the twenty third checking out means that's when you're going to leave that's

22
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:10,170
when you're going out.

23
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:10,430
OK.

24
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:10,830
OK.

25
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:12,080
I got it I got it.

26
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:19,890
Is it just you now they could also ask how many guests how many guests if it's a larger booking than

27
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:26,280
they might say how many rooms if you suggest something about you needing maybe multiple rooms at the

28
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:30,870
beginning they'll say Oh how many rooms do you need maybe your booking for a group of people.

29
00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:35,470
But here you just said I need to book a room I need to book a room.

30
00:01:35,550 --> 00:01:38,310
So we want to know how many people will be in that room.

31
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:39,310
How many guests.

32
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:40,580
Is it just you.

33
00:01:40,730 --> 00:01:41,350
OK.

34
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:42,290
Me and my wife.

35
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:50,040
I could say to two guests and I could if I wanted to say this one just me and my wife only two I could

36
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:55,050
also say only two guests justice just two guests.

37
00:01:55,050 --> 00:01:57,140
All of those are OK ways to say this.

38
00:01:57,150 --> 00:02:02,970
Now sometimes the guest you the person who's going to stay there will want to know if there are rooms

39
00:02:02,970 --> 00:02:04,550
available on those dates.

40
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:06,410
You might ask for example.

41
00:02:06,510 --> 00:02:07,930
Do you have.

42
00:02:08,010 --> 00:02:13,290
Do you have any vacancies.

43
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:18,160
Instead of saying just the dates maybe it's a very busy weekend coming up.

44
00:02:18,210 --> 00:02:24,680
You know there are many many people coming to the city for maybe a conference or something like that.

45
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:31,020
And you're worried that maybe the hotel will have no space so you could say do you have any vacancies

46
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:37,210
for the weekend of the twenty eighth for example for the weekend of the 28.

47
00:02:37,230 --> 00:02:38,840
Do you have any vacancies.

48
00:02:38,850 --> 00:02:43,680
Unfortunately sir we don't have any vacancies.

49
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:45,470
We don't have any vacancies.

50
00:02:45,470 --> 00:02:48,380
We are fully booked.

51
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:52,830
So if a restaurant or a hotel has no more space no more vacancy.

52
00:02:52,830 --> 00:02:59,580
And sometimes there will be a sign outside of a small hotel which says no vacancy no space available.

53
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:00,750
They're fully booked.

54
00:03:00,890 --> 00:03:04,210
OK so maybe you're calling around to different hotels.

55
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:10,710
Finally you've found the Volt maybe not a very popular hotel and they have some vacancies so you could

56
00:03:10,710 --> 00:03:17,430
ask like that normally you don't need to do that normally you just say I'd like to book several nights.

57
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:19,940
I'd like to book three nights from the twenty third.

58
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:25,020
OK so that's only when you think that maybe they won't have spaces available.
