1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:06,150
The receptionist has asked us if we have any questions and we may have several.

2
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:12,300
I know when I want to stay at a hotel for the first time I usually have quite a few questions and sometimes

3
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:19,590
I will book a room on the phone because I have questions I don't want to book online sometimes because

4
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:25,080
I want to ask some of these important questions so let's explore a few of them.

5
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:26,750
Of course there could be many more.

6
00:00:26,790 --> 00:00:30,450
What are the gym hours and when is breakfast.

7
00:00:30,450 --> 00:00:34,230
What are the gym hours and when is breakfast.

8
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:36,650
OK now gym hours.

9
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:38,960
That means when is the gym open.

10
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:39,730
Maybe.

11
00:00:39,810 --> 00:00:47,340
Maybe you like to work out or you like to have a workout and when you travel it's very important for

12
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:48,660
you to exercise.

13
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:51,690
So you need to go to the gym in the hotel.

14
00:00:51,690 --> 00:00:56,970
OK so you want to know when you can and when you can't and when is breakfast What time is breakfast

15
00:00:56,970 --> 00:00:57,680
served.

16
00:00:57,690 --> 00:01:05,750
I want to mention something really quickly about this w o r o UTI and w o k o u t one word or two words.

17
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:08,550
Well it depends on how we're using it.

18
00:01:08,550 --> 00:01:13,620
We could say workout as one word if we use it as one word then it's a noun.

19
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:21,150
If we say it as two words then now it's a phrase all verb and it's the same for example for take off

20
00:01:21,660 --> 00:01:24,140
and take off those two words.

21
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:30,720
That's a phrase all verb phrase a verb usually has a preposition and a verb together first it's a verb

22
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:37,170
than a preposition or a verb followed by an adverb and there are many phrases verbs you can learn them

23
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:37,940
on your own.

24
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:44,060
Very important to learn them though because they're a very important part of spoken English or take

25
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:46,340
off and that becomes a noun.

26
00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:47,670
How would we use these.

27
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:54,480
Well the plane will take off in ten minutes.

28
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:56,370
That's an action that's going to happen.

29
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:58,460
So we should use the phrase will verb.

30
00:01:58,470 --> 00:02:06,900
Two words however when the plane does take off and then we're able to take off our seat belts.

31
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:08,360
Different Meaning of takeoff.

32
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:15,540
Then we could say we took off our seatbelts after takeoff and now takeoff is being used as a noun because

33
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:21,400
it's an event after this event happened so before takeoff and after takeoff.

34
00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:24,810
Now the plane will take off phrase a verb.

35
00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:25,650
Same here.

36
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:29,970
Workout after my workout my workout.

37
00:02:29,970 --> 00:02:31,410
How is your workout.

38
00:02:31,410 --> 00:02:32,160
It was very good.

39
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:36,020
My workout my workout was very good.

40
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:42,210
I need to work out every day to stay sane to stay happy.

41
00:02:42,210 --> 00:02:43,830
I need to work out every day.

42
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:46,110
So this one phrase a verb this one now.

43
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:47,400
Basically that's how it works.

44
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:49,620
There are lots of examples like that.

45
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:52,060
I just wanted to mention it quickly.

46
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:55,530
OK so answer breakfast is included with your room.

47
00:02:55,530 --> 00:02:59,130
I didn't ask that question but it's useful information.

48
00:02:59,130 --> 00:03:01,190
It means I don't need to pay extra.

49
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:04,980
Maybe the standard room doesn't have breakfast included.

50
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:07,650
Maybe I need to pay extra for breakfast.

51
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:09,820
That's a big extra cost.

52
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:16,410
OK so it's nice to have the deluxe room because breakfast is included remember that means it's part

53
00:03:16,410 --> 00:03:21,990
of the cost of the room and that's from 7:00 a.m. to 11:00 a.m..

54
00:03:21,990 --> 00:03:26,440
Now you could say 7:00 to 11:00 a.m. And that would be fine too.

55
00:03:26,490 --> 00:03:29,750
Could we say between 7 and 11:00 a.m..

56
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:31,830
Of course of course.

57
00:03:31,890 --> 00:03:33,240
We've learned that by now.

58
00:03:33,270 --> 00:03:33,680
All right.

59
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:36,180
The gym is always open.

60
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:43,200
We could also say if something is always open 24 7 sometimes it's written like that sometimes it's written

61
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:44,810
like that.

62
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:45,960
What does that mean.

63
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:48,720
People often ask me what does 24/7 mean.

64
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:54,750
Well it means 24 hours a day 24 days a week 24/7.

65
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:56,330
That means it's always open.

66
00:03:56,430 --> 00:03:57,600
It's never closed.

67
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:04,060
So that one is very common you often will see that in front of things like convenience stores.

68
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:07,940
We can also say the gym is always open so you don't need to worry about that.

69
00:04:08,010 --> 00:04:11,300
No need to worry about that you can go to the gym at 2:00 a.m. If you want.

70
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:15,020
Will you be needing transportation from the airport.

71
00:04:15,070 --> 00:04:19,990
OK this one is asking basically are you flying in.

72
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:25,080
And if so do you need a way to get to the hotel from the airport.

73
00:04:25,110 --> 00:04:28,080
If you're coming from another city you could be driving.

74
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:30,640
If so you wouldn't need transportation from the airport.

75
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:38,880
You could if you're flying in take another type of transportation like a taxi but maybe this hotel offers

76
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,590
a shuttle service.

77
00:04:40,590 --> 00:04:50,640
It's often called the airport shuttle S H U T T L E service which is just back and forth like this offered

78
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:54,630
by maybe a specific hotel and the airport shuttle.

79
00:04:54,630 --> 00:05:00,810
The difference between that and a bus is generally that a shuttle only does this and only has two stops.

80
00:05:00,810 --> 00:05:01,330
Hotel.

81
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:02,130
Airport hotel.

82
00:05:02,130 --> 00:05:02,620
Airport.

83
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:05,250
Whereas a bus usually stops along the way.

84
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:08,310
Church makes all the stops.

85
00:05:08,310 --> 00:05:09,600
That's the general difference.

86
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,750
OK so that's the answer to the question.

87
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:16,740
Now let's get into the shuttle situation and how much that will cost.

88
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:19,410
If we do want to get the airport shuttle.

89
00:05:19,590 --> 00:05:27,270
If we're flying into a city and we're planning to stay at a hotel we often need to get to the hotel

90
00:05:27,330 --> 00:05:32,610
which is usually downtown but usually the airport is rather far away from downtown.

91
00:05:32,850 --> 00:05:37,880
Most of the time airports are not in the middle of the city although sometimes they are.

92
00:05:37,950 --> 00:05:43,640
Which is interesting and very convenient for people flying but maybe not for local people.

93
00:05:43,650 --> 00:05:49,770
So we've been asked if we need transportation from the airport to the hotel.

94
00:05:49,770 --> 00:05:54,080
That suggests that they offer it but we should still confirm.

95
00:05:54,210 --> 00:05:58,980
Yes actually yes actually means I do need that sort of transportation.

96
00:05:58,980 --> 00:06:00,650
This is the guest.

97
00:06:00,690 --> 00:06:04,340
This is the receptionist and this is the guest.

98
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:05,090
Yes.

99
00:06:05,130 --> 00:06:09,220
In fact we use actually when we want to say this is the reality.

100
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:11,310
Actually I'm really really hungry.

101
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:16,230
For example do you offer shuttle service shuttle service.

102
00:06:16,230 --> 00:06:17,300
You can call it that.

103
00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:20,320
And if so how much is it.

104
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:26,550
We often use this if so structure to ask a question about one thing.

105
00:06:26,550 --> 00:06:29,880
If the answer is yes before we get the yes answer.

106
00:06:29,970 --> 00:06:34,470
So for example do you have a vegetarian menu.

107
00:06:34,470 --> 00:06:37,080
Vegetarian means someone who doesn't eat meat.

108
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:39,610
If so could I look at it please.

109
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:43,830
If the answer is yes could I please look at the vegetarian menu.

110
00:06:43,830 --> 00:06:44,580
Do you have that.

111
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:46,760
If so could I look at it.

112
00:06:46,830 --> 00:06:50,400
That's before I get the answer yes because maybe it's yes maybe it's no.

113
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:53,950
It's a very useful very useful way of asking questions.

114
00:06:53,970 --> 00:06:56,320
Actually it's complementary.

115
00:06:56,430 --> 00:07:01,240
Now this complementary is often used by hotels and restaurants.

116
00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:07,380
A lot of customer service or service oriented businesses too mean free.

117
00:07:07,410 --> 00:07:09,470
Basically it means free.

118
00:07:09,690 --> 00:07:12,190
Oh sir that is actually complimentary.

119
00:07:12,210 --> 00:07:18,750
We would like to give you this towel complimentary this complimentary towel with our logo on it to remember

120
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:19,720
your stay here.

121
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:25,590
Whatever it's complimentary maybe a complimentary breakfast is a free breakfast and it's sort of a fancy

122
00:07:25,590 --> 00:07:28,580
way more formal way of saying it's free.

123
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:31,240
If we say yes we have free shuttle service.

124
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:38,040
It just sounds a little maybe a little cheap although it is the same meaning the shuttle leaves every

125
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,240
hour on the hour.

126
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:46,160
If we say every hour that could be a little confusing because that could be 10 20 11 20 12 20.

127
00:07:46,230 --> 00:07:46,760
Right.

128
00:07:46,830 --> 00:07:52,500
What we want to say is when we say every hour on the hour leaves at 11:00 it leaves at 12:00.

129
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:53,780
It leaves at 1.

130
00:07:53,790 --> 00:08:00,630
It leaves at 2 on the hour doesn't leave it doesn't leave at eleven 10 it doesn't leave at 11:00 0 5

131
00:08:00,990 --> 00:08:06,600
it leaves at eleven and if you miss the eleven you need to take the 12:00 12:00 p.m. for example.

132
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:10,770
So just look for the one what the shuttle.

133
00:08:10,770 --> 00:08:17,400
The shuttle is often used to replace the word bus means the bus can look for the one with the unbuilt

134
00:08:17,490 --> 00:08:26,280
hotel logo in the parking lot in front of terminal to terminal 2 T2 sometimes T1 T2 terminal is the

135
00:08:26,670 --> 00:08:28,550
long area where all the planes are.

136
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:29,650
OK great.

137
00:08:29,670 --> 00:08:35,930
That's a way to say Awesome fantastic because nothing else needs to be done right.

138
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:39,280
If I really want to take a taxi when I get there I can.

139
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:44,170
But now I know that I don't need to arrange the shuttle service.

140
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:49,100
It's just there and it leaves every hour on the hour so I don't need to do anything else here.

141
00:08:49,110 --> 00:08:51,000
I have this information I'm done.

142
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,100
That's my question.

143
00:08:52,110 --> 00:08:52,760
I'm finished.
