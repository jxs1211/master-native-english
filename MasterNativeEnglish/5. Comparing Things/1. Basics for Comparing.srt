1
00:00:04,340 --> 00:00:12,740
So in the last lesson we talked about how we can invite friends to do things with us in a very natural

2
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:14,380
and informal way.

3
00:00:14,510 --> 00:00:22,010
Like most situations but in this video I want to talk about how we talk about the differences between

4
00:00:22,010 --> 00:00:26,740
things or the similarities between things differences.

5
00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:30,980
I think you probably know this word and similarities.

6
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:34,810
What is kind of the same or almost the same and what is very different.

7
00:00:34,810 --> 00:00:41,660
OK now we're going to talk about what we call comparatives how we compare things this thing and this

8
00:00:41,660 --> 00:00:42,160
thing.

9
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:50,720
And we can compare all kinds of things we can compare objects actually physical things or we can compare

10
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:57,410
ideas we can compare things in time we can compare amounts of things.

11
00:00:57,410 --> 00:01:01,220
There are all sorts of things that we need to compare in everyday life.

12
00:01:01,220 --> 00:01:09,590
So if you know how to do this and you can do it very easily and naturally then you're able to very specifically

13
00:01:09,950 --> 00:01:11,510
explain for example.

14
00:01:11,620 --> 00:01:12,730
No I don't want that one.

15
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:14,010
I want that one.

16
00:01:14,030 --> 00:01:14,930
Which one.

17
00:01:14,930 --> 00:01:17,870
The one which is a little bit more blah blah blah.

18
00:01:17,870 --> 00:01:20,900
So we're going to learn that in today's lesson.

19
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:23,960
So let's just get started with some of the basics.

20
00:01:23,990 --> 00:01:33,620
You probably have said and have heard people say bigger than smaller then or more interesting then less

21
00:01:33,620 --> 00:01:34,900
interesting then.

22
00:01:35,030 --> 00:01:41,270
So why is it that sometimes we use her and sometimes we use more or less.

23
00:01:41,270 --> 00:01:48,200
So I want to go through some examples so that this is clear and then we'll then we'll go on and do some

24
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:52,070
more complicated some more detailed comparisons.

25
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:55,020
But first we have to start with the basics.

26
00:01:55,040 --> 00:02:06,540
So why is it that we might say this apple is more is the basic structure delicious than that to Apple.

27
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:06,990
OK.

28
00:02:07,010 --> 00:02:10,200
This apple is more delicious than that apple.

29
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:16,830
And over here we might say over here we might say this is easier.

30
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:17,780
You are right.

31
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:24,980
This is easier than I thought it would be.

32
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:25,490
OK.

33
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:26,520
So here we have two.

34
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:35,760
One uses E R and one is using more and then this one is also using then they all use then.

35
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:41,840
Well at least when we're talking about the differences between things one and another and how they're

36
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:44,380
different it's pretty simple actually.

37
00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:52,000
Why this one E R is usually when there are one or two syllables.

38
00:02:52,010 --> 00:02:55,260
Now if you don't know a syllable a syllable is a beat in a word.

39
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:57,460
So let's look at the word just very quickly.

40
00:02:57,470 --> 00:02:57,880
Let's work.

41
00:02:57,890 --> 00:02:59,960
Look at the word basketball.

42
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:05,900
If I look at the word basketball it's very difficult to tell how many syllables are or beats are in

43
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:06,740
the word.

44
00:03:06,740 --> 00:03:14,660
But if we actually say it out loud we can hear the number of bump bump bump beats in the word basketball.

45
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:16,120
Now that's easy for me to hear.

46
00:03:16,130 --> 00:03:21,920
But sometimes when you're learning English it can be a little bit difficult to hear how many that is.

47
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:22,990
My name is Luke.

48
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:25,650
How many syllables does my name have.

49
00:03:25,730 --> 00:03:26,880
One or two.

50
00:03:26,930 --> 00:03:31,910
Actually it's one but to make sure you can hear it correctly say the word with your mouth closed.

51
00:03:31,970 --> 00:03:33,790
Luke hmm hmm hmm hmm.

52
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:35,780
I'm saying it but my mouth is closed.

53
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,660
There's only one beat.

54
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:38,350
OK.

55
00:03:38,450 --> 00:03:39,370
Basketball.

56
00:03:39,490 --> 00:03:43,040
Hmm hmm hmm hmm hmm hmm hmm hmm hmm.

57
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:44,190
Three syllables.

58
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:46,170
So when you're looking at how many syllables.

59
00:03:46,190 --> 00:03:46,930
Don't look at.

60
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:52,790
Don't look at the letters in the word because you can have a long word with not many syllables and a

61
00:03:52,790 --> 00:03:55,340
short word with many syllables.

62
00:03:55,340 --> 00:03:56,590
It's more about the sound.

63
00:03:56,630 --> 00:03:59,840
And to get a feeling for it close your mouth and then you can hear it.

64
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:02,720
What's the rule then why are we talking about syllables.

65
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:11,750
Well generally if you have one or two syllables then you're going to use her for example faster easier.

66
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:11,990
All right.

67
00:04:11,990 --> 00:04:12,980
Easy easy.

68
00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:15,110
Two syllables fast fast.

69
00:04:15,110 --> 00:04:17,190
Bigger smaller.

70
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:24,140
And then if you have three syllables or more like delicious How many syllables are in the word delicious

71
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:26,510
delicious delicious.

72
00:04:26,930 --> 00:04:27,710
Three syllables.

73
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:31,180
OK so more delicious.

74
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:32,120
That's got all of them there.

75
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:36,050
Don't worry then more delicious then.

76
00:04:36,230 --> 00:04:36,750
OK.

77
00:04:36,830 --> 00:04:41,350
More interesting then more beautiful then more appealing then.

78
00:04:41,390 --> 00:04:44,330
OK so three or more syllables.

79
00:04:44,330 --> 00:04:50,750
Now there are some times when you'll see a two syllable word also using more then.

80
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:57,520
So for example if you say funny you say funnier funnier he is funnier than him.

81
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:59,350
Tom is funnier than Jerry.

82
00:04:59,360 --> 00:04:59,640
That's.

83
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:00,170
That's right.

84
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:01,130
That's totally correct.

85
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:10,130
But also you'll see Tom is more funny than Jerry and that is correct as well.

86
00:05:10,210 --> 00:05:15,910
So for two syllable words I would say generally speaking use her.

87
00:05:15,910 --> 00:05:20,470
But there are some cases where more is much more common.

88
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:28,900
And it's just because of the way that language is in language you never really know why something is

89
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:34,690
more popular than another why why this word is more common than this word or this way of saying it is

90
00:05:34,690 --> 00:05:35,560
more common.

91
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:42,910
So you really just have to pay attention and look out for cases where two syllable adjectives use more

92
00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:44,530
instead of her.

93
00:05:44,590 --> 00:05:46,360
Here's a perfect example.

94
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:51,850
More more common then you really don't see.

95
00:05:51,850 --> 00:05:55,980
Commoner then more common that is pretty much the only way it's done.

96
00:05:56,170 --> 00:06:01,840
So you have to look out for these when it comes to the two syllable words for the one syllable words

97
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:09,370
and the three syllable words pretty much always you can say this is E R and this is more or less in

98
00:06:09,370 --> 00:06:09,710
fact.

99
00:06:09,730 --> 00:06:14,590
Same rule but for the two syllable ones you really have to pay attention again as a general rule.

100
00:06:14,590 --> 00:06:15,880
Go for e r.

101
00:06:15,970 --> 00:06:17,800
Sometimes it depends on the sound.

102
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:22,100
For example the word tender already has e r at the end.

103
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:28,120
So if you say tender tenderer tender sounds a bit strange right.

104
00:06:28,150 --> 00:06:34,810
So it will be more common to say more tender just because of the earth sound of the adjective Wicked

105
00:06:34,810 --> 00:06:37,000
is also another good example.

106
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:41,760
Wicked means someone is really bad really bad or cruel to others right.

107
00:06:41,770 --> 00:06:42,970
Very wicked.

108
00:06:42,970 --> 00:06:45,590
Actually it has a more modern meaning as well.

109
00:06:45,590 --> 00:06:52,360
Something is really cool people say Oh man that's wicked but I don't know if that's popular anymore

110
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:53,090
anyway.

111
00:06:53,590 --> 00:06:59,860
Wicked would be one where you would say more wicked then just because it sounds a little bit weird to

112
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:07,480
say wicked or wicked or it's kind of hard to say so sometimes because it's hard to say or because it

113
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:12,760
sounds weird people prefer more even though it's a two syllable word.
