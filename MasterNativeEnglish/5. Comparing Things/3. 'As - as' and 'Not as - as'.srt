1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:05,410
Now when we're doing comparatives These are called comparatives comparing things.

2
00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:15,660
We can also use as and when we use as we don't use then we also don't use E R and we also don't use

3
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:17,240
more or less.

4
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:25,260
So if you're using this or this you can say the same things often but again you're not using more you're

5
00:00:25,290 --> 00:00:26,550
not using less.

6
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:30,710
You're not using her and you're not using fan.

7
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:34,200
This one means that two things are the same.

8
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:34,370
OK.

9
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:41,610
So this is basically the best way to say that two things are the same same size the same quality whatever

10
00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:42,720
you want to say.

11
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:49,890
And the cool thing about it is it doesn't matter how many syllables there are there are two syllables

12
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:51,090
or three syllables.

13
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:57,140
If there's one syllable one hundred syllables No no one hundred syllable words doesn't matter.

14
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:59,380
Ok not as same.

15
00:00:59,420 --> 00:01:00,540
It doesn't matter.

16
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:09,020
The difficulty here is that this as as means they're equal but this means that one is less than another.

17
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:11,250
So they're not exactly opposites.

18
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:16,350
OK just means one is actually less it's the same as saying less then.

19
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:17,120
OK.

20
00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:18,440
So let's look at some examples.

21
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:22,260
Sharman is as warm as Hong Kong warm.

22
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:25,550
We can put in other words here we could say humid humid.

23
00:01:25,780 --> 00:01:26,020
OK.

24
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:33,060
We could say longer words we could say Charlotte is as interesting as Hong Kong.

25
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:35,120
Doesn't matter how many syllables we have.

26
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:37,970
And it means again in my mind they're the same.

27
00:01:37,980 --> 00:01:45,820
Of course it's my opinion it's my opinion I am or I'm as smart as my brother.

28
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:54,150
We could say other words here longer words as intellectual as my brother as maybe interesting or whatever

29
00:01:54,150 --> 00:01:56,670
we want to say it doesn't matter.

30
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:58,140
It means we're equal.

31
00:01:58,140 --> 00:01:58,660
OK.

32
00:01:58,710 --> 00:02:08,640
But when we use not as something as it means the first thing we say is less then the second thing we

33
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:09,200
say.

34
00:02:09,210 --> 00:02:19,890
So it's sort of like saying my house is less expensive than his house My house is not as expensive as

35
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:21,450
his house.

36
00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:23,100
So those two are the same.

37
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:24,330
It's almost the same.

38
00:02:24,330 --> 00:02:32,940
It is the same as using less then less expensive then not as expensive as it's the same.

39
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:33,890
Same meaning.

40
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:35,880
So let's look at some examples.

41
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:42,620
This coffee is not quite as good as Starbucks.

42
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:47,340
This coffee is not quite as good as Starbucks.

43
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:56,250
Now why would we sometimes say not as good as instead of using less well Remember less is only used

44
00:02:56,430 --> 00:02:59,850
when we have two or three or more syllables.

45
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:07,710
So if we want to use words like good it's often very useful to use as instead because we can't say less

46
00:03:07,710 --> 00:03:14,940
good than we would have to change the whole sentence and we would say we would have to say this coffee

47
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:21,600
is worse than Starbucks but maybe that doesn't give us the right feeling because worse makes this coffee

48
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:23,160
look really really bad.

49
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:28,830
Maybe people will judge it too much but what we really want to say is Starbucks is here and this coffee

50
00:03:28,830 --> 00:03:31,550
is a little bit less just here.

51
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:35,720
And so we can use not as good as because it doesn't mean much less.

52
00:03:35,730 --> 00:03:37,600
It can just be a little bit.

53
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:43,310
This coffee is not quite as good as Starbucks by adding quite here.

54
00:03:43,350 --> 00:03:47,150
I focus on the fact that they're nearby.

55
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:48,570
They're nearby they're close.

56
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:55,110
It's almost as good as almost as good as Starbucks but not quite as good.

57
00:03:55,110 --> 00:04:01,410
So again this is a very useful way to be able to express not that something is negative or completely

58
00:04:01,410 --> 00:04:06,070
opposite but that it's just less and we can use the same adjective.

59
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:08,940
Doesn't matter how many syllables so it's a great way to do it.

60
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:17,190
And we can add words like quite to say that it's very close and nearly to say that it's very far.

61
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:21,110
So this is like this coffee and there's Starbucks.

62
00:04:21,150 --> 00:04:25,580
This one I'm not nearly as old as him.

63
00:04:25,590 --> 00:04:28,110
This means the distance is very far.

64
00:04:28,110 --> 00:04:34,470
It's like saying I'm much younger than him I am much younger younger than him.

65
00:04:34,470 --> 00:04:45,790
So this one is like maybe he's I don't know 50 and I'm 24 much younger not as old as same K same.

66
00:04:45,810 --> 00:04:47,910
So we don't have to change the adjective.

67
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:54,600
And from our example that we'll look at in a minute you'll see how this is a really useful way to express

68
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:56,460
that something is less.
