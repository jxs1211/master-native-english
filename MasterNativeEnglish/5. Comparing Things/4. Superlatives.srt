1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:06,270
We've been talking about comparatives how we can in detail describe the differences between things but

2
00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:13,470
I feel like before we really look at some examples of how to put all these things together we can very

3
00:00:13,470 --> 00:00:23,040
quickly talk about superlatives superlatives like a superlative as when you have something that is either

4
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:26,390
all the way at the top or all the way at the bottom.

5
00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:31,710
OK it's not just more or less it's all the way up here or all the way down here.

6
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:33,830
So there used to kind of two compare.

7
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:39,000
You might compare something and then say that one is the for example most beautiful.

8
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,380
This one is more beautiful.

9
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:45,900
It's talking about these two things A is more beautiful than B and then A is the most beautiful.

10
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:52,560
That means not only is it more beautiful than B it's more beautiful than all other things to be in that

11
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:53,430
category.

12
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:53,690
OK.

13
00:00:53,700 --> 00:01:01,380
So it follows the same rules that we learned before when we have one or two syllables then we'll add

14
00:01:01,470 --> 00:01:10,740
e s t est instead of her right for superlatives fastest funniest coolest boldest quietest.

15
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:11,210
Right.

16
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:14,580
But you could also hear for example say most quiet.

17
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:17,700
It's OK if you said most funny.

18
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:18,440
It's OK.

19
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:19,470
It's also OK.

20
00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:22,220
So in these cases you can do you can do both.

21
00:01:22,230 --> 00:01:28,160
And again you just need to pay attention to how these are used and which ones are more common.

22
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:33,390
So then for these it's the same rule again three syllables or more.

23
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:36,030
And sometimes two like these.

24
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:40,760
So least experienced nothing is less than that.

25
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:42,510
It's the least experienced.

26
00:01:42,510 --> 00:01:43,140
OK.

27
00:01:43,230 --> 00:01:45,820
We don't need to use it then because we're not comparing.

28
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:53,730
We don't have to add then my brother is the least experienced maybe doctor I've ever met.

29
00:01:53,730 --> 00:01:56,100
Which would be very scary least fortunate.

30
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:57,330
Again it's the lowest.

31
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:57,770
OK.

32
00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:04,290
We're just using adjectives here fortunate experienced again these are three syllables or more and sometimes

33
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:11,250
two syllables like this one for example we wouldn't say usually we wouldn't say bizarre list but we

34
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:13,830
would often say most bizarre.

35
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:22,020
So the rule is the same for at least in most least as here most is here most bizarre most excited most

36
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:28,440
fortunate most experienced least experienced least fortunate least excited least.

37
00:02:28,490 --> 00:02:29,320
Bizarre.

38
00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:38,130
So pay attention when you're listening to movies or talking with people to whether or not for two syllable

39
00:02:38,130 --> 00:02:46,920
words people are using more or they're using her or they're using est or they're using most or at least

40
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:48,840
parts of pay attention to that.

41
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:54,660
And now let's look at some real examples of how we can sort of put all this together.
