1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:05,490
So we've looked at how we can compare everything and how we can talk about superlatives as well.

2
00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:12,120
Now let's put everything together and look at some examples of what people might actually say if they're

3
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:15,800
trying to describe for example transportation.

4
00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:17,540
So let's look at two cities.

5
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:19,770
Let's look at Shanghai and Beijing.

6
00:00:19,850 --> 00:00:20,400
OK.

7
00:00:20,510 --> 00:00:25,670
You have two cities Shanghai Beijing and we have cost how much money.

8
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:33,990
And we have time we'll look at cost and time and then we have three what we would call modes modes of

9
00:00:33,990 --> 00:00:37,260
transportation bus train and a plane.

10
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:43,410
So let's just try to use the things we've learned and compare these three modes of transportation when

11
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:49,920
we're talking about cost time and we'll talk about these two locations as our destination and point

12
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:51,490
of origin flying.

13
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:59,520
That would be taking it taking a plane flying to Beijing from Shanghai is more expensive again expensive

14
00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:05,890
more syllables more expensive than taking a train or a bus taking a train or a bus.

15
00:01:05,910 --> 00:01:08,790
It's the most costly way to travel.

16
00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:11,380
We could say most expensive if we want to.

17
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:18,870
But changing the adjective sometimes using a synonym costly and expensive are the same allows us to

18
00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:21,290
have a little variation.

19
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:22,010
OK.

20
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:28,560
So we have the superlative here most costly are comparative here and we just put these two together

21
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:33,110
because this one flying is more than both of them.

22
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:34,470
OK let's try another one.

23
00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:44,100
Taking a train from Shanghai to Beijing is more expensive more expensive than taking a bus but not as

24
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:48,950
expensive as not as expensive as.

25
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:55,920
Remember how we said if we use less sometimes we have to change the adjective and that can make it a

26
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:58,030
little bit awkward sometimes.

27
00:01:58,030 --> 00:02:04,650
Now remember we talked about how this means the same as less so we could put less in here as well so

28
00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:09,380
but less expensive then less expensive than flying.

29
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:10,200
OK.

30
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:19,050
Going to Beijing from Shanghai by bus takes longer than longer or because Long is one syllable.

31
00:02:19,050 --> 00:02:27,240
So we have her going to Beijing from Shanghai by bus takes longer than flying or taking a train.

32
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:31,500
So again this is both but this one is about time takes longer.

33
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:35,160
We say earlier because Long is one syllable.

34
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:36,980
It's the slowest.

35
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:40,890
Again we use asked here because slow is one syllable.

36
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:43,100
It's the slowest way to get there.

37
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:45,120
It's the slowest way to get there.

38
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:53,840
Last example flying to Beijing from Shanghai is faster than taking a bus or a train train or a bus.

39
00:02:53,850 --> 00:03:01,830
One thing to keep in mind is how we actually change adjectives sometimes if we're talking about something

40
00:03:01,830 --> 00:03:11,790
that is maybe not as bad as that sometimes is better and sometimes not as good as sometimes better and

41
00:03:11,790 --> 00:03:15,570
sometimes not as good as using her.

42
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:19,480
So let's look at this one going to Beijing from Shanghai.

43
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:29,930
By bus is not as fast as or we could say is slower than flying or taking a train.

44
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:32,200
It's the slowest way to get there.

45
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:38,640
So we could choose which one we want depending on what kind of feeling we want to give or what kind

46
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:46,620
of mood we want to create if we want to have the same adjective slow then we should say probably going

47
00:03:46,650 --> 00:03:51,850
to Beijing from Shanghai is slower than flying or taking a train.

48
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:53,750
It's the slowest way to get there.

49
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:58,850
But I like to if I can have some variation and use a different word.

50
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:05,160
So if I want to use a different word then maybe this one is actually better because I'm saying not as

51
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:15,330
fast as which is the same meaning as slower than going to Beijing from Shanghai by bus is not as fast

52
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:18,190
as flying or taking a train.

53
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:20,400
It's the slowest way to get there.

54
00:04:20,670 --> 00:04:28,740
I prefer that one because I like to have some variation in what I say I like to be able to describe

55
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:35,070
something and use different adjectives so that I don't sound like I'm I'm limited to only saying the

56
00:04:35,070 --> 00:04:36,130
words slow.

57
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:38,770
So keep that in mind when you're comparing things.

58
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:46,320
Keep in mind that you can use sometimes either one and the one that you choose can change the impression

59
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:52,500
people have about what you say even though both of them are correct to practice this.

60
00:04:52,500 --> 00:05:00,290
What I'd like you to do is choose two restaurants that you like and compare them just because you both

61
00:05:00,290 --> 00:05:02,420
doesn't mean they're exactly the same.

62
00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:06,000
OK try to use the phrases as many as you can.

63
00:05:06,050 --> 00:05:13,470
The phrases or the structures we learned in this lesson try to use not as and as as.

64
00:05:13,550 --> 00:05:18,390
Try to use then try to use more less or asked.

65
00:05:18,410 --> 00:05:19,470
Try to use them all.

66
00:05:19,490 --> 00:05:24,960
If you can compare the price and also compare the atmosphere.

67
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:32,990
That means the feeling that you have about the place maybe one place is more casual or more lively or

68
00:05:33,050 --> 00:05:41,540
maybe the price maybe one place is a high end high end place which means it's more expensive or maybe

69
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:50,270
fancier whatever you want to say not as maybe not as casual as whatever you want to say try to be as

70
00:05:50,270 --> 00:05:58,310
detailed as you can try to be as specific as you can and really practice these expressions then try

71
00:05:58,310 --> 00:06:04,640
to do it again recording yourself and then listen to it don't write it down the second time do it about

72
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:09,790
something else for example maybe two parks that you like or or whatever.

73
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:17,240
Record yourself speaking naturally using these expressions and that will force you to have to use these

74
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:23,810
in the moment on your feet and that will challenge you to actually get better to improve yourself so

75
00:06:23,810 --> 00:06:30,530
that when you have a conversation it's easy to use comparatives and superlatives even though you probably

76
00:06:30,710 --> 00:06:31,790
know them.

77
00:06:31,790 --> 00:06:36,110
It's easy to use them in conversations which is the goal right.

78
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:36,690
All right.

79
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:37,290
Good luck.
