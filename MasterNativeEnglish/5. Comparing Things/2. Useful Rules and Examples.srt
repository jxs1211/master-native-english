1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:05,250
So let's just go through some examples and I'm going to include less than here.

2
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:09,270
We've been talking about more than and her right.

3
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:12,160
But we can include less a..

4
00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:13,260
Then as well.

5
00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:16,230
And it follows the same basic rules.

6
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:21,600
If you wanted to say more beautiful then you could also say less beautiful then.

7
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:25,510
But what if we want to then say the opposite with R.

8
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:31,620
Well then you have to change the adjective if you want to say less beautiful then it might be better

9
00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:38,330
if you just say uglier than ugly ugly or uglier than right.

10
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:43,630
It's the same thing less beautiful then may be the same as uglier then.

11
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:50,080
So it follows the same basic rules same basic rules we just use less instead of more.

12
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:57,910
Or choose an opposite adjective an opposite adjective and had e r let's go through some basic examples.

13
00:00:57,930 --> 00:01:01,650
Is there anything more beautiful than a sunset.

14
00:01:01,650 --> 00:01:06,590
Is there anything more beautiful than a sunset sunset is when the sun goes down.

15
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:08,660
This is a rhetorical question.

16
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:11,280
That means you don't need to answer the question.

17
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:12,500
I'm just saying it.

18
00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:15,480
Is there anything more beautiful than than a sunset.

19
00:01:15,510 --> 00:01:18,900
Learning English is more interesting than I thought.

20
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:23,070
So here we're not comparing two things exactly right.

21
00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:30,900
More interesting than I thought were comparing sort of an opinion about something now to an opinion

22
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:34,840
about something in the past like me now and me in the past.

23
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:42,540
This as I sort of see it and as I experience it is much more interesting than me back then and how I

24
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:44,420
felt about it then learning English.

25
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:45,800
So this is sort of like the noun.

26
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:49,070
Learning English is more interesting than I thought.

27
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:50,290
This is an hour.

28
00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:55,720
It doesn't say Mo's hit my r's sometimes look like S's.

29
00:01:55,740 --> 00:02:02,240
This hospital is much less professional than my usual one.

30
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:09,480
We could say usual hospital but it's not necessary because the last thing that we said Well at least

31
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:13,530
the topic the thing we're talking about is hospital.

32
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:22,260
And so when we say one we know it's about hospital then my usual hospital than my usual one.

33
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:25,900
So one can often replace a noun.

34
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:26,290
OK.

35
00:02:26,370 --> 00:02:32,700
Now here's an interesting exception where we have a special word that we can use which is the opposite

36
00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:33,880
of better.

37
00:02:33,890 --> 00:02:34,110
All right.

38
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:39,410
If this hospital is better this hospital is better than my usual one.

39
00:02:39,570 --> 00:02:40,610
That's easy right.

40
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:44,250
E.R. You have a special word we don't say more good.

41
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:52,530
We don't say more better we just say better could say my usual hospital is better than this one.

42
00:02:52,650 --> 00:02:59,100
So one simple way to express the opposite is to just reverse the order of the things instead of saying

43
00:02:59,550 --> 00:03:02,250
this hospital is less professional.

44
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:02,780
Right.

45
00:03:02,790 --> 00:03:08,490
We could just say my usual hospital is much better than this one.

46
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:08,790
OK.

47
00:03:08,850 --> 00:03:10,650
Or much more professional.

48
00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:13,160
Of course that's also something we could do.

49
00:03:13,230 --> 00:03:18,570
But what if we want to say the same thing and instead we want to use E.R..

50
00:03:19,230 --> 00:03:22,150
Well here is where we have a special exception.

51
00:03:22,170 --> 00:03:34,850
We have this special word worse worse as a special one this hospital is much worse is much worse than

52
00:03:34,850 --> 00:03:40,100
my usual one is much worse than my usual one.

53
00:03:40,130 --> 00:03:47,140
So that's the opposite word to use and it's a special case we don't add E.R. We don't say worser.

54
00:03:47,150 --> 00:03:51,440
Couple more examples you're cooler than you were last year.

55
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:53,650
You're cooler than you were last year.

56
00:03:53,930 --> 00:03:57,760
So again this is not two things but it kind of is.

57
00:03:57,770 --> 00:04:04,190
Except it's two people but it's not really two people although it kind of is because it's about two

58
00:04:04,190 --> 00:04:05,530
different times.

59
00:04:05,570 --> 00:04:16,700
This is person A maybe in two thousand and nine and this is person A in two thousand and ten.

60
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:18,860
I don't know why those years it's not this year.

61
00:04:18,860 --> 00:04:22,950
So we could say you're cooler than you were last year.

62
00:04:22,970 --> 00:04:28,790
That means now is more cool than 2009.

63
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:39,140
If we wanted to switch that around then we could say in 2009 you weren't as cool as you are this year

64
00:04:39,410 --> 00:04:40,490
and we'll talk about that.

65
00:04:40,490 --> 00:04:42,650
Not as cool as in a moment.

66
00:04:42,650 --> 00:04:44,840
You're better than me at ping pong.

67
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:47,400
You're better than me at ping pong.

68
00:04:47,630 --> 00:04:51,530
I'm worse than you at ping pong.

69
00:04:51,530 --> 00:04:54,340
I'm worse than you at ping pong.

70
00:04:54,660 --> 00:05:00,960
OK now if we wanted to make it another word and we wanted to use more or less we could use skilled.

71
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:04,790
For example you're more skilled than me at ping pong.

72
00:05:04,850 --> 00:05:11,300
So let's go into a couple other types of comparison before we get into some deeper examples.
