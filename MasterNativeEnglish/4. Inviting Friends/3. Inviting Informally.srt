1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:05,340
So now that we've done the first two steps of our phone call situation where we're going to invite a

2
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:09,470
friend we can actually get to the phrases that we can use to invite.

3
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:15,000
Now I want to avoid using very fake sounding phrases like I would like to invite you to go out to dinner

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:15,970
with me.

5
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:19,380
Don't don't do that unless you're talking to the Queen of England.

6
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:22,070
Nobody actually speaks that way.

7
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:23,690
It's way too formal.

8
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:28,150
So we need to look at some informal ways to do an invitation.

9
00:00:28,220 --> 00:00:29,880
Informal invitations.

10
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:32,510
OK so how can we do it naturally.

11
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:36,910
Remember we're inviting someone to go and eat something with us.

12
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:37,830
So let's do this.

13
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:38,540
Let's let's.

14
00:00:38,530 --> 00:00:40,200
Let's look at a couple of phrases.

15
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:43,110
I was thinking this is very common.

16
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:50,940
I was thinking I was thinking now this is a very common phrase to use in invitations because it makes

17
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:53,510
it feel like there's not too much pressure on you.

18
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:55,820
It feels like I'm planning to do this.

19
00:00:55,890 --> 00:00:58,610
And if you decide not to go it's no big deal.

20
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:00,420
I don't want to put too much pressure on you.

21
00:01:00,450 --> 00:01:04,260
If I say please please have lunch with me.

22
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:06,030
We know what's wrong with you.

23
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:07,890
It's a little too.

24
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:09,120
Too much pressure.

25
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:13,210
So we want to we want to be kind of relaxed and this is the right.

26
00:01:13,230 --> 00:01:14,320
This is the right phrase.

27
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:22,360
I was thinking of going to grab a bite to eat to grab.

28
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:27,460
Which is a very common word in English used which actually means this grab.

29
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:35,430
But actually it can often mean get it can often mean get and it can often mean by grab a bite.

30
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:40,210
This is a common phrase a bite to eat I eat.

31
00:01:40,210 --> 00:01:40,710
OK.

32
00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:46,800
I was thinking of going to grab a bite to eat going to grab a sandwich going to grab a cup of coffee

33
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:49,330
going to grab a hamburger.

34
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:51,370
Doesn't mean you're going to grab it and run.

35
00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:53,270
It just means you're going to get that.

36
00:01:53,370 --> 00:01:56,000
It's a it's a very relaxed and casual way to say it.

37
00:01:56,130 --> 00:01:56,630
OK.

38
00:01:56,680 --> 00:02:03,300
That's a common phrase probably I don't know if it's number one but up there with one of the most common

39
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:04,890
or maybe it's a group.

40
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:08,520
Me and some friends.

41
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:11,410
This is another way to say this is happening.

42
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:15,840
So if you decide not to go it's not a big deal in American culture.

43
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:21,380
It's important not to pressure people too much if you say I really really really need you to be there.

44
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:24,300
That will only be in a few situations.

45
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:25,500
It's pretty rare.

46
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:31,120
Generally we want to give people the feeling of freedom if you decide not to go it's OK.

47
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:34,950
I'd like you to be there but it's OK if you don't if you don't go.

48
00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:38,210
Me and some friends maybe you've learned some friends and I.

49
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:40,170
But we can also say me and some friends.

50
00:02:40,170 --> 00:02:41,340
Many people use it.

51
00:02:41,550 --> 00:02:45,260
Are are going out tonight.

52
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:53,220
Now usually going out this phrase going out that's an OH YOU'LL GET USED TO MY HANDWRITING going out

53
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:53,880
tonight.

54
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:58,230
That means having drinks probably maybe going to a bar or a nightclub.

55
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:03,660
It generally means you're going to have a beer or alcohol or what we call drinks.

56
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:06,450
If somebody says Would you like to get a drink.

57
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:10,450
It doesn't mean let's go have some milk.

58
00:03:10,570 --> 00:03:12,160
It would be funny.

59
00:03:12,210 --> 00:03:15,690
It means let's get some alcohol.

60
00:03:15,690 --> 00:03:18,960
So me and some friends are going out tonight.

61
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:20,710
Would you Would you.

62
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:23,970
Now this is this is very polite but still natural.

63
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:30,450
Would you care care or like to come along.

64
00:03:30,450 --> 00:03:31,290
Do you care to come along.

65
00:03:31,290 --> 00:03:32,730
Would you like to come along.

66
00:03:32,730 --> 00:03:35,080
Do you want to come along is also OK.

67
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:36,150
Do you want to come along.

68
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:37,140
Would you like to come along.

69
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:39,100
Would you care to come along.

70
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:40,680
Very common all of them.

71
00:03:40,770 --> 00:03:45,360
Again this is a way to invite someone to do something that you're already going to do anyway.

72
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:45,590
OK.

73
00:03:45,630 --> 00:03:46,990
Let's look at some other phrases.

74
00:03:47,010 --> 00:03:48,810
I'm starving.

75
00:03:48,810 --> 00:03:49,780
I'm starving.

76
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:52,130
That means dying from hunger.

77
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:59,270
Often when we speak in English we we exaggerate a little we say a little bit more than we actually mean.

78
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:03,510
So if someone says I'm starving are they actually starving.

79
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:05,180
Are they actually dying from hunger.

80
00:04:05,290 --> 00:04:06,660
New new.

81
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:11,610
But we say it as a way to make what we are saying a little bit stronger.

82
00:04:11,610 --> 00:04:12,980
It's a common way to do it.

83
00:04:13,050 --> 00:04:17,920
If somebody says I'm dying or oh it's killing me my head is killing me.

84
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:20,900
They're not actually dying their head is not actually killing them.

85
00:04:20,910 --> 00:04:25,140
It's a way to express something is very strong it's very painful it's killing me.

86
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:26,810
I'm so hungry I'm starving.

87
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:28,390
It's common very common.

88
00:04:28,410 --> 00:04:29,250
I'm starving.

89
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:30,010
I'm starving.

90
00:04:30,030 --> 00:04:38,070
Want to want to go get something to eat.

91
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:42,850
Want to go get something to eat and instead of saying want to go get something to eat.

92
00:04:42,870 --> 00:04:49,980
We often use to or to make it sound more natural more smooth want to go get something to eat and instead

93
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:57,900
of saying want to we might say one to one to want to is the same as saying one when we're speaking naturally

94
00:04:57,930 --> 00:05:00,630
we'll often say one to one to go get.

95
00:05:00,630 --> 00:05:06,320
Now you might have heard that go and get shouldn't be together but actually in some cases it's common.

96
00:05:06,330 --> 00:05:09,370
We're gonna go there and then we're going to get it.

97
00:05:09,450 --> 00:05:15,390
We could say Go get we could say go grab you want to go grab something to eat you want to go grab a

98
00:05:15,390 --> 00:05:19,050
coffee you want to go grab a sandwich or a burger.

99
00:05:19,050 --> 00:05:19,980
Very common.

100
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:21,260
Want to go get something to eat.

101
00:05:21,270 --> 00:05:23,000
I'm starving.

102
00:05:23,010 --> 00:05:23,640
I'm starving.

103
00:05:23,670 --> 00:05:24,510
I'm starving.

104
00:05:24,510 --> 00:05:26,100
Let's go get something to eat.

105
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:27,750
Want to go get something to eat.

106
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:28,260
OK.

107
00:05:28,290 --> 00:05:29,370
All very common.

108
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:33,270
Now I want to just mentioned one thing we can't say want to join me after this.

109
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:33,870
I'm starving.

110
00:05:33,870 --> 00:05:39,230
Want to join me because you didn't say what thing you're going to do in the first so when we said I'm

111
00:05:39,230 --> 00:05:46,340
going to go grab something I'm going to go grab lunch I'm going to go grab something to eat.

112
00:05:46,350 --> 00:05:47,520
Want to join me.

113
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:53,290
Want to join me or want to join me because I said what I'm going to do then I can say Join me.

114
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:58,620
But if I say I'm starving then it doesn't make sense to say do you want to come along.

115
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:01,580
Do you want to join me because I didn't say what I'm doing.

116
00:06:01,590 --> 00:06:03,780
I just said how I feel.

117
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:07,310
So now I should say want to go get something to eat.

118
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:14,220
Now I have to make the request first I say what I feel and then I ask you if you want to do what I would

119
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:15,870
like to do with me.

120
00:06:15,990 --> 00:06:21,300
Now here's another one that's really common when we want to make somebody feel that they can say yes

121
00:06:21,450 --> 00:06:22,070
or no.

122
00:06:22,110 --> 00:06:25,450
And it's OK because I'm going to do it anyway.

123
00:06:25,590 --> 00:06:29,340
So if I say I'm about to.

124
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:33,090
If somebody says I'm about to that means it's going to happen very soon.

125
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:39,230
This is a way of saying something will be soon you wouldn't say about two if it's maybe in a year.

126
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:40,470
I'm about to get a job.

127
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:45,650
That doesn't mean in a year that means maybe this week it's very soon OK.

128
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:51,150
I'm about to I'm about to have dinner and we could.

129
00:06:51,150 --> 00:06:55,440
Of course we could also say we could add go if you want to say go have dinner.

130
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:56,530
About to have dinner.

131
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:58,730
I'm about to go have dinner fun.

132
00:06:58,770 --> 00:07:01,290
I'm about to have dinner then.

133
00:07:01,370 --> 00:07:03,640
Hungry Hungry.

134
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:10,470
It means are you hungry but often native English speakers instead of saying are you will cancel are

135
00:07:10,470 --> 00:07:11,190
you.

136
00:07:11,190 --> 00:07:15,650
Or is it in many situations and just say one word.

137
00:07:16,470 --> 00:07:19,190
But you have to say it with the right tone.

138
00:07:19,410 --> 00:07:22,190
For example we might say are you ready.

139
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:26,400
Now notice my voice goes Dent dent into Dent and then the.

140
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:27,510
Are you ready.

141
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:30,680
But often we'll just cancel are you.

142
00:07:30,870 --> 00:07:33,050
Instead we'll say ready.

143
00:07:33,290 --> 00:07:33,750
Ready.

144
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:38,900
But if you say ready that means I am ready because of the tone.

145
00:07:38,910 --> 00:07:40,020
Are you ready.

146
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:41,260
I am ready.

147
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:42,300
Ready.

148
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:43,110
Ready.

149
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:47,140
But for hungry we don't usually say hungry.

150
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:49,280
Sounds a little weird.

151
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:50,020
Hungry.

152
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:51,170
Yes.

153
00:07:51,210 --> 00:07:52,200
Is the right answer.

154
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:52,890
Yeah.

155
00:07:53,190 --> 00:07:53,730
Yeah.

156
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:55,000
Starving.

157
00:07:55,050 --> 00:07:55,950
Not so much.

158
00:07:55,950 --> 00:07:56,550
Hungry.

159
00:07:56,550 --> 00:07:57,150
Yes.

160
00:07:57,150 --> 00:07:58,110
It's very common.

161
00:07:58,110 --> 00:07:58,500
Hungry.

162
00:07:58,890 --> 00:07:59,850
Yes.

163
00:07:59,850 --> 00:08:02,010
Now this means.

164
00:08:02,010 --> 00:08:07,250
Do you want to eat with me even though I didn't exactly say do you want to eat with me.

165
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:14,990
It's suggested by me being here asking you if I just say hungry and you say yes.

166
00:08:15,090 --> 00:08:18,750
Then I said OK let's go right now and you sound.

167
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:20,180
No no no no no no no.

168
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:21,890
I don't want to eat with you.

169
00:08:21,890 --> 00:08:22,890
I'm hungry.

170
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:26,080
I have my food right here.

171
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:30,330
That would be so so rude and very very bad.

172
00:08:30,530 --> 00:08:38,600
If you say yes to hungry what you're really saying yes to is going with me to eat.

173
00:08:38,780 --> 00:08:42,250
If I say I'm starving I'm about to go have dinner.

174
00:08:42,530 --> 00:08:43,330
Hungry.

175
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:46,010
And you say yeah it means yes.

176
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:49,590
And I would like to go eat with you.

177
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:53,150
It doesn't mean yes I'm hungry but I'm going to eat by myself.

178
00:08:53,150 --> 00:08:53,890
No no no.

179
00:08:53,900 --> 00:09:00,670
Saying you're hungry is although you're not saying it directly is saying yes to going with me.

180
00:09:00,710 --> 00:09:02,370
So that's important to keep in mind.

181
00:09:02,450 --> 00:09:07,550
Sometimes when we say something what we really mean is underneath.

182
00:09:07,550 --> 00:09:07,900
Right.

183
00:09:07,910 --> 00:09:18,560
It's suggested based on the situation based on what's happening care for a cup of coffee.

184
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:21,290
Care for what does that mean here.

185
00:09:21,290 --> 00:09:29,030
Well actually we're not saying it but really there is a would you would you care for is the same as

186
00:09:29,030 --> 00:09:34,950
saying Would you like if I have some chocolate here and I say Would you like a piece of chocolate then

187
00:09:34,970 --> 00:09:37,660
you can say Oh yes please I would like a piece of chocolate.

188
00:09:37,850 --> 00:09:43,090
That's a common thing to say but I could just say care for a piece of chocolate.

189
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:48,890
Care for a piece of chocolate and you have to know in your mind that what I'm saying is would you care

190
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:50,700
for a piece of chocolate.

191
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:53,410
I can't say like a piece of chocolate I can say.

192
00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:55,080
Would you like a piece of chocolate.

193
00:09:55,130 --> 00:09:57,980
Cannot say like a piece of chocolate.

194
00:09:57,980 --> 00:10:00,170
Care for a piece of chocolate.

195
00:10:00,170 --> 00:10:01,100
Yes I can say that.

196
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:05,020
That's very common means I would like to know if you would like that.

197
00:10:05,210 --> 00:10:13,250
But because it's spoken English we often cancel Would you just say care for very common now.

198
00:10:13,550 --> 00:10:18,290
It could mean that I have a cup of coffee right here and I give it to you.

199
00:10:18,290 --> 00:10:19,590
Probably not though.

200
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:21,260
What does it probably mean.

201
00:10:21,260 --> 00:10:26,810
It probably means I would like you to go with me to get some coffee together.

202
00:10:26,810 --> 00:10:30,230
So you'll stand up from your desk if we're maybe we're co-workers.

203
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:32,870
Hey hey.

204
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:34,910
Care for a cup of coffee.

205
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:35,930
Yeah sure.

206
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:37,020
Stand up.

207
00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:37,600
Go.

208
00:10:37,610 --> 00:10:39,070
That's a way of saying.

209
00:10:39,170 --> 00:10:41,800
Would you like to go with me to get a cup of coffee.

210
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:47,120
Again it can be used if it's something that I have right here and I want to know if you want that thing

211
00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:52,010
then I can also say care for a care for a whatever this is.

212
00:10:52,490 --> 00:10:54,150
You can say Oh yeah sure.

213
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:54,820
Yeah sure.

214
00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:55,270
Yeah.

215
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:55,850
Sure.

216
00:10:55,850 --> 00:11:00,000
If you want to agree right away just say yeah great.

217
00:11:00,020 --> 00:11:01,160
Yes.

218
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:03,770
Sure sounds good.

219
00:11:03,770 --> 00:11:10,780
Sounds great sometimes of course it's like I can't believe you didn't ask me before.

220
00:11:10,790 --> 00:11:13,520
Of course means absolutely yes.

221
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:16,640
In fact we can say absolutely.

222
00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:17,700
Absolutely.

223
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:19,870
Absolutely means absolutely yes.

224
00:11:19,870 --> 00:11:20,570
Very strong.

225
00:11:20,570 --> 00:11:21,010
Yes.

226
00:11:21,020 --> 00:11:21,480
Right.

227
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:22,190
Definitely.

228
00:11:22,190 --> 00:11:23,950
We can say definitely as well.

229
00:11:23,990 --> 00:11:26,850
There are lots of different ways to agree and say yes.

230
00:11:26,930 --> 00:11:27,750
Sounds good.

231
00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:28,960
Yes sure.

232
00:11:28,970 --> 00:11:35,270
These are all very very common in this sort of situation and lots of other situations very common ways

233
00:11:35,270 --> 00:11:39,350
to agree to things and say yes to questions.

234
00:11:39,350 --> 00:11:40,280
Absolutely.

235
00:11:40,310 --> 00:11:41,780
Yes of course.
