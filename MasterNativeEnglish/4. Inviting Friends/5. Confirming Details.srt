1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:04,690
So let's just run through it really quick up to the point where we decide what to eat.

2
00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:05,010
All right.

3
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:05,760
Hello.

4
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:06,320
Hey.

5
00:00:06,570 --> 00:00:07,210
Hey Luke.

6
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:09,040
Hey how's it going.

7
00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:10,210
It's going all right.

8
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:10,930
You.

9
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:11,350
Yeah.

10
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:15,660
Going pretty well just sitting around at home eating some snacks.

11
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:15,890
OK.

12
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:16,530
Cool.

13
00:00:16,530 --> 00:00:17,310
How are you.

14
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:18,720
You're free to talk.

15
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:19,430
Yeah yeah.

16
00:00:19,430 --> 00:00:20,400
Free to talk.

17
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:21,950
What's up.

18
00:00:21,950 --> 00:00:26,400
Well I was thinking of going to grab some dinner tonight.

19
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:29,380
Would you like to come along yeah.

20
00:00:29,390 --> 00:00:29,870
Sounds great.

21
00:00:29,870 --> 00:00:31,280
What time.

22
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:34,590
How about How about seven.

23
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:36,380
Seven work for you.

24
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:40,510
Actually at 7:00 I need to go pick up my friend from the airport.

25
00:00:40,670 --> 00:00:42,500
Could we move it to 8:00.

26
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:43,190
Yeah sure.

27
00:00:43,190 --> 00:00:45,680

28
8:00 works 8:00 works.

29
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:46,190
All right.

30
00:00:46,190 --> 00:00:47,660

31
8:00 sounds great.

32
00:00:47,660 --> 00:00:51,290
What did you have in mind.

33
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:54,930
Or we could say what were you thinking of having.

34
00:00:54,950 --> 00:00:56,920
What were you thinking of eating.

35
00:00:56,990 --> 00:01:00,220
What kind of thing would you like to eat.

36
00:01:00,230 --> 00:01:01,640
Basically these expressions.

37
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:03,320
What did you have in mind.

38
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:05,870
Did you can say Do you have in mind.

39
00:01:06,050 --> 00:01:13,550
But we often say did because it makes it sound a little softer or we say What were you thinking of eating

40
00:01:13,550 --> 00:01:14,740
or having.

41
00:01:14,740 --> 00:01:18,280
It's a very strange have I know but you'll get used to it.

42
00:01:18,290 --> 00:01:20,800
What were you thinking of having.

43
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:28,550
These are very very very common or what are you in the mood for if you invite me and then I say to you

44
00:01:28,570 --> 00:01:28,860
OK.

45
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:29,960
Yeah sounds great.

46
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:30,880
I'd love to go.

47
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:36,890
What were you thinking of having and you go oh I don't know you haven't thought about where to eat right.

48
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:42,580
So then maybe you need to say to me What are you in the mood for.

49
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:43,580
You're inviting me.

50
00:01:43,580 --> 00:01:44,840
Why are you asking me what.

51
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:48,770
I'm in the mood for that means what do I feel like eating.

52
00:01:48,770 --> 00:01:50,370
What do I want to eat.

53
00:01:50,390 --> 00:01:50,600
All right.

54
00:01:50,630 --> 00:01:51,200
That's fine.

55
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:55,190
Then I say you're inviting me but I'm deciding where we eat.

56
00:01:55,190 --> 00:01:58,720
Ok then I say How about.

57
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:03,260
So the way we suggest things often is to use.

58
00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:04,400
How about

59
00:02:07,510 --> 00:02:07,950
OK.

60
00:02:08,090 --> 00:02:10,610
How about Thai food.

61
00:02:10,610 --> 00:02:12,450
I know a great Thai restaurant.

62
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:18,950
But you the person inviting me you had Thai food for lunch just to be clear that's Thai.

63
00:02:18,950 --> 00:02:24,820
Thai is the adjective for Thailand the adjective is shorter than the name of the country.

64
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:26,210
So Thai food.

65
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:27,820
How about How about Thai food.

66
00:02:27,830 --> 00:02:29,660
I know a great Thai restaurant.

67
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:32,400
Actually it's near your house.

68
00:02:32,690 --> 00:02:35,490
Actually I'm not really in the mood.

69
00:02:35,510 --> 00:02:37,170
We often start sentences this way.

70
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:40,130
Actually I'm not really in the mood for Thai.

71
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:45,210
We don't have to say food after every type of food every type of cuisine.

72
00:02:45,230 --> 00:02:49,510
I'm not really in the mood for Thai because actually I had it for lunch.

73
00:02:49,550 --> 00:02:54,020
I just had it for lunch just means very recently.

74
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:58,310
Oh OK well what are you in the mood for.

75
00:02:58,340 --> 00:03:02,840
Now I'm asking you you're the person who's asking me first where I'd like to go.

76
00:03:02,870 --> 00:03:05,660
Now I'm asking you what are you in the mood for.

77
00:03:05,690 --> 00:03:07,250
What do you feel like eating.

78
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:11,450
Now maybe you have a friend who knows a good place.

79
00:03:11,450 --> 00:03:15,510
My friend told me about a really good sushi restaurant.

80
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:17,120
I've never been there.

81
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,150
That's USA Chai.

82
00:03:18,530 --> 00:03:20,980
My friend told me about a really good sushi restaurant.

83
00:03:20,990 --> 00:03:21,980
I've never been there.

84
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:22,810
How about that.

85
00:03:23,050 --> 00:03:23,280
Yeah.

86
00:03:23,290 --> 00:03:24,270
Sounds great.

87
00:03:24,290 --> 00:03:25,220
That's great.

88
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:27,320
You should have said that the first time right.

89
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:31,640
Because you're inviting me and you asked me what I felt like eating.

90
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:34,520
I told you and you said no because you had it for lunch.

91
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:36,570
So now it's back to you.

92
00:03:36,710 --> 00:03:41,470
And now you tell me about a place your friend told you about OK.

93
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:46,510
Or have you ever been to and then maybe places called Sushi sushi.

94
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:49,210
That's a good name for a sushi restaurant.

95
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,710
If you were been to sushi Sushi.

96
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:52,070
Oh I've never been there.

97
00:03:52,070 --> 00:03:52,940
It's good.

98
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:53,630
Yeah it's great.

99
00:03:53,630 --> 00:03:55,000
It's fantastic.

100
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:57,820
It's the best the best sushi in the city.

101
00:03:57,830 --> 00:03:58,320
All right.

102
00:03:58,460 --> 00:03:59,600
Sounds good.

103
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:00,530
Sounds good.

104
00:04:00,530 --> 00:04:01,190
Sounds great.

105
00:04:01,190 --> 00:04:04,150
Again we can use that same expression to say yes.

106
00:04:04,170 --> 00:04:04,690
All right.

107
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:09,470
So when we want to say no we say I don't really feel like it I'm not in the mood for it.

108
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:10,640
We want to say yes we say.

109
00:04:10,670 --> 00:04:11,570
Sounds great.

110
00:04:11,570 --> 00:04:12,410
Sounds great.

111
00:04:12,670 --> 00:04:12,940
OK.

112
00:04:12,950 --> 00:04:17,360
Have you ever been to have you ever been to have you ever had.

113
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:18,970
Just to be clear these are separate.

114
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:25,490
Have you ever had if you say Have you ever had then maybe we won't say the name of the restaurant.

115
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:28,840
Maybe we'll say the type of food.

116
00:04:28,850 --> 00:04:31,120
Have you ever had Ethiopian food.

117
00:04:31,650 --> 00:04:32,800
Oh it's amazing.

118
00:04:32,810 --> 00:04:33,920
No I haven't.

119
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:36,580
I know a really good Ethiopian restaurant.

120
00:04:36,590 --> 00:04:37,630
How about that.

121
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:38,390
Sounds great.

122
00:04:38,510 --> 00:04:38,690
Yeah.

123
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:39,440
Let's go.

124
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:45,200
So in this lesson we've talked about everything you need to know when you want to invite people to do

125
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:46,470
things.

126
00:04:46,490 --> 00:04:47,810
We're using food in this case.

127
00:04:47,810 --> 00:04:53,120
We talked about how to do small talk how to make sure other people are free how to ask people why they're

128
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:57,970
calling us how to actually invite in a casual and natural way.

129
00:04:58,070 --> 00:05:04,430
Lots of phrases for that how to say no politely how to say yes politely and show different levels of

130
00:05:04,430 --> 00:05:11,390
excitement and also how to decide where to eat how to get other people's suggestions and how to give

131
00:05:11,390 --> 00:05:14,420
our own suggestions even if we haven't been there.

132
00:05:14,450 --> 00:05:20,600
Now at the end of the call all you have to do is confirm the person who is inviting the person who is

133
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:26,900
asking the other person to go out for dinner that person is the one who should confirm at the end of

134
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:28,970
the call to do that.

135
00:05:28,970 --> 00:05:30,920
All they have to do is start with.

136
00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:37,710
So any time you want to confirm information just to make sure you say so.

137
00:05:37,730 --> 00:05:39,340
So it's pretty simple.

138
00:05:39,350 --> 00:05:43,220
All you do is say everything that you talked about until now.

139
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:52,810
So I'll see you I'll see you at Sushi sushi at 8:00 p.m..

140
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:57,050
I'll I'll text you the address.

141
00:05:57,170 --> 00:05:58,750
Texts can be a verb here.

142
00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:01,450
That means send it as a text message.

143
00:06:01,490 --> 00:06:02,120
I'll see you.

144
00:06:02,150 --> 00:06:06,300
So I'll see you at Sushi sushi at 8:00 p.m..

145
00:06:06,410 --> 00:06:10,290
I'll text you the address then I say all I have to say is great.

146
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:11,300
Great.

147
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:12,410
Can't wait.

148
00:06:12,590 --> 00:06:14,660
Can't wait.

149
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:15,560
Can't wait.

150
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:16,760
See you then.

151
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:20,490
See you then.

152
00:06:20,510 --> 00:06:20,900
Great.

153
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:21,900
Can't wait.

154
00:06:22,010 --> 00:06:22,850
See you then.

155
00:06:22,850 --> 00:06:23,150
All right.

156
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:24,800
So this is how we invite people.

157
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:27,850
This is how we say things politely in this kind of situation.

158
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:32,930
It's important to remember that the phrases we learned today are not the only phrases there are many

159
00:06:32,930 --> 00:06:33,570
more.

160
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:38,500
And you can do variations of these kind of mix them together in many cases.

161
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:44,390
There are many many possibilities more than we could ever cover in even a whole course.

162
00:06:44,390 --> 00:06:44,650
All right.

163
00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:51,730
So to practice this recorded dialogue get your phone out and turn on the record function.

164
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:57,680
Record yourself recording is a great way to actually practice because you have to listen to it and you'll

165
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:02,810
hear some mistakes and you'll catch yourself and get used to self-correcting.

166
00:07:03,140 --> 00:07:07,240
So record yourself recorded dialogue between two friend.

167
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:09,240
You need to play both people.

168
00:07:09,510 --> 00:07:09,890
Right.

169
00:07:09,890 --> 00:07:12,500
Don't be embarrassed because you're you're in a room by yourself.

170
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:15,530
Just try it and you might have fun with it.

171
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:19,350
And if you do try it again try to do it two or three different ways.

172
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:26,810
Try to use as many of the expressions that we learned in this lesson as you can and again have fun with

173
00:07:26,810 --> 00:07:27,320
it.

174
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:34,520
This is basically all of the general stuff you need to know in the invitation situation.

175
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:35,540
So good luck.
