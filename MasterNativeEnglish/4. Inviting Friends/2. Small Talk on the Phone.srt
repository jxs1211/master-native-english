1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:04,110
Now if you call your friend and you just say Hey do you want to eat now.

2
00:00:04,260 --> 00:00:11,580
It's not a terrible thing but usually when you call your friend you don't just say directly what you

3
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:12,240
want.

4
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:18,210
You need to have a little bit of free chat a little bit of small talk especially if you haven't talked

5
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:19,880
to your friend in a little while.

6
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:27,300
So there are some common questions that we ask in this sort of situation and many many other situations

7
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:30,930
that we can use to catch up.

8
00:00:30,930 --> 00:00:37,470
Which means to talk about things you haven't talked about since you last saw each other or just have

9
00:00:37,470 --> 00:00:40,200
a bit of what we would call small talk.

10
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:42,200
So here are the common questions that we use.

11
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:43,060
And there are more.

12
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:45,410
But here are some really common ones.

13
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:46,630
What's up.

14
00:00:46,630 --> 00:00:47,250
Hey what's up.

15
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:49,350
Now what does what's up really mean.

16
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:50,550
What's up.

17
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:56,130
Actually means not how are you but what are you doing.

18
00:00:56,130 --> 00:00:57,750
How are you.

19
00:00:57,780 --> 00:00:59,430
It's different than what's up.

20
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:00,950
Let's just be clear about that.

21
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:01,800
OK.

22
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:03,080
You say what's up.

23
00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:04,630
It means either.

24
00:01:04,770 --> 00:01:07,160
What are you doing right now.

25
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,130
What's wrong.

26
00:01:08,190 --> 00:01:08,760
There's a problem.

27
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:09,180
What's up.

28
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:09,930
What's up.

29
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:10,520
What happened.

30
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:10,770
Right.

31
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:14,610
There's a problem or sometimes it means nothing.

32
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:20,730
Often what's up is used as a phrase in situations like this.

33
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:26,350
You're in the office and you pass your coworker and your coworker goes Hey.

34
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:32,520
And you go Hey what's up in that case sometimes it's just like saying hi or hello.

35
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:38,700
You can answer it but usually when people answer it in that kind of situation it's like nothing not

36
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:39,220
much.

37
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:40,520
Nothing.

38
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:43,380
Nothing.

39
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:54,200
Not much these are common answers to what's up and then usually people will say you butt in the phone

40
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:55,070
call situation.

41
00:01:55,070 --> 00:01:56,650
You could actually say what you're doing.

42
00:01:56,660 --> 00:02:00,410
So they call you and say oh hey hey what's up.

43
00:02:00,410 --> 00:02:07,520
I'm just sitting at home watching TV or actually I'm doing some homework or I'm about to go to work.

44
00:02:07,550 --> 00:02:12,080
You can say what you're doing OK now that's different than how are you.

45
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,670
If someone says How are you.

46
00:02:13,670 --> 00:02:19,120
Obviously you can say I'm good I'm OK I'm great I'm fine right.

47
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:24,140
But we don't even need to go into that one because it's it's so basic.

48
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:27,050
However we can look at this one.

49
00:02:27,530 --> 00:02:29,240
How's it going.

50
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:30,320
How is it going.

51
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:32,150
How is it going.

52
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:33,680
That means how are you.

53
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:35,720
It's exactly the same as how are you.

54
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:38,840
Except we say How's it going.

55
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:40,260
What is it.

56
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,990
It's like your your situation.

57
00:02:41,990 --> 00:02:42,760
Right.

58
00:02:42,770 --> 00:02:47,610
So when you answer we often then use it to answer it's going all right.

59
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:49,990
It's going fine it's going great.

60
00:02:50,090 --> 00:02:52,630
Instead of saying I'm great I'm all right.

61
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,020
I'm fine.

62
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:56,270
But again basically it's the same thing.

63
00:02:56,270 --> 00:02:57,980
How have you been.

64
00:02:57,980 --> 00:02:59,720
Now we've learned.

65
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:00,930
Have you been.

66
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:01,240
Right.

67
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:07,280
We've learned that this means including now and also recently.

68
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:09,740
Right including now and also recently.

69
00:03:09,740 --> 00:03:14,040
So let's say I haven't seen you in two weeks and I say How have you been.

70
00:03:14,150 --> 00:03:20,500
When you answer me you might talk about some of the things that have happened in the last two weeks

71
00:03:21,670 --> 00:03:23,260
because I haven't talked to you since then.

72
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:26,380
So if I say how do you mean you can say Yeah I've been.

73
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:27,880
Same same grammar.

74
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:35,310
Usually the answer matches the question I've been pretty well although I've been quite busy recently

75
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:37,870
with work or I've been okay.

76
00:03:37,890 --> 00:03:43,010
Last week I got a cold and I'm still I'm still recovering but cold.

77
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:44,890
Okay so here.

78
00:03:44,970 --> 00:03:45,990
Have you been.

79
00:03:45,990 --> 00:03:49,620
It's not just now it's over time until now.

80
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:55,830
And we often then we'll add something after it first you answer I've been pretty well and then you can

81
00:03:55,830 --> 00:03:57,010
add something else.

82
00:03:57,090 --> 00:03:58,600
I just bought a new car.

83
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:00,150
I've been sick recently.

84
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:02,370
I'm going to Florida next week.

85
00:04:02,370 --> 00:04:03,310
Whatever.

86
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:04,080
OK.

87
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:06,850
How about how have things been.

88
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:08,030
How have things been.

89
00:04:08,130 --> 00:04:08,530
Again.

90
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:18,810
This is pretty much the same except again the answer the answer usually matches the question.

91
00:04:18,930 --> 00:04:21,510
So how have things been.

92
00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:23,340
Things have been OK.

93
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:24,480
Things have been great.

94
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:26,050
Things have been fantastic.

95
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:27,480
Things have been all right.

96
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:28,590
It's the same thing.

97
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:29,800
It just looks different.

98
00:04:29,850 --> 00:04:30,840
Sort of like this one.

99
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:33,620
How's it going is the same as how are you right.

100
00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:39,990
Actually there are only a couple of questions but they take different forms and the answer usually matches

101
00:04:40,110 --> 00:04:42,610
the question which is important to keep in mind.

102
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:47,600
Sometimes instead of what's up you hear what's going on.

103
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:48,600
It's the same thing.

104
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,940
Basically what are you up to.

105
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:56,420
Sometimes we hear up to up to going on what's going on.

106
00:04:56,430 --> 00:04:57,960
What are you doing.

107
00:04:58,050 --> 00:04:58,940
What are you up to.

108
00:04:58,950 --> 00:04:59,780
What are you doing.

109
00:04:59,790 --> 00:05:00,280
What's up.

110
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:01,520
What are you doing.

111
00:05:01,530 --> 00:05:03,090
Pretty much all the same.

112
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:06,330
And to answer this after you say for example what's up.

113
00:05:06,420 --> 00:05:07,500
Oh not much.

114
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:10,300
Just watching some youtube videos.

115
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:12,160
Then you'll say you.

116
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:13,370
How about you.

117
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:16,220
You asked the same question back you.

118
00:05:16,230 --> 00:05:18,620
That means I'm asking you the same question.

119
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:19,560
You don't have to.

120
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:21,560
You could say another question.

121
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:22,770
How have you been.

122
00:05:22,770 --> 00:05:23,950
I've been pretty well.

123
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:27,050
I was sick last week but I'm doing pretty well now.

124
00:05:27,090 --> 00:05:29,470
Although next week I have a big exam.

125
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:30,780
This is small talk.

126
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:35,180
Just talk about things that have been going on and things you're doing now for maybe a minute.

127
00:05:35,310 --> 00:05:40,200
And it's not really strict it should be very casual and you should have some things to talk about because

128
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:41,030
you're friends.

129
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:43,500
So then once you've done a little bit of small talk.

130
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:49,980
One thing that people will often do especially on a phone call is to ask Are you busy now this.

131
00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:56,100
Are you busy can often mean and usually means right now in this moment or are you in the middle of anything

132
00:05:56,430 --> 00:05:58,770
or are you free to talk.

133
00:05:58,770 --> 00:06:05,550
Am I interrupting anything so I'm trying to get a feeling for whether or not my phone call is bothering

134
00:06:05,550 --> 00:06:06,180
you.

135
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:11,370
Is my phone call causing you to have to stop doing something and actually you're very busy and you don't

136
00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:13,550
really want to talk to me now.

137
00:06:13,670 --> 00:06:14,160
OK.

138
00:06:14,190 --> 00:06:15,000
Are you busy.

139
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:15,770
No I'm not busy.

140
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:16,730
I'm free.

141
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:17,610
Are you busy.

142
00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:20,040
Yeah I'm a little bit busy now.

143
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:20,800
OK.

144
00:06:20,850 --> 00:06:22,660
Are you in the middle of anything.

145
00:06:22,870 --> 00:06:24,090
I should be middle sorry.

146
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:24,940
That's an owl.

147
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:26,670
Are you in the middle of anything.

148
00:06:26,670 --> 00:06:28,290
No I'm not.

149
00:06:28,290 --> 00:06:30,510
I'm free in the middle of something.

150
00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:33,440
I'm in the middle of something means I'm kind of busy.

151
00:06:33,450 --> 00:06:34,950
Are you in the middle of something.

152
00:06:34,950 --> 00:06:36,660
Are you in the middle of anything.

153
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:37,410
No I'm free.

154
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:38,400
OK.

155
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:39,690
Are you free to talk.

156
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:40,110
Yeah.

157
00:06:40,140 --> 00:06:41,280
I'm free.

158
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:42,630
No not right now.

159
00:06:42,630 --> 00:06:44,560
I'm a little bit busy.

160
00:06:44,610 --> 00:06:55,310
I'm kind of in the middle of something to make things sound softer we often add kind of and a bit so

161
00:06:55,310 --> 00:07:00,190
we can say for example I'm kind of in the middle of something.

162
00:07:00,290 --> 00:07:05,630
I'm kind of busy right now or I'm a bit busy right now.

163
00:07:05,630 --> 00:07:07,210
I'm a bit busy right now.

164
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:15,700
I'm a bit tied up right now tied up means like you're tied up you can't do anything because you're busy.

165
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:16,960
OK I'm a bit tied up right now.

166
00:07:16,970 --> 00:07:18,650
I'm kind of tied up right now.

167
00:07:18,710 --> 00:07:20,970
I'm a bit busy at the moment.

168
00:07:20,990 --> 00:07:25,460
Am I interrupting anything interrupt means to stop somebody from doing something.

169
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:27,310
No you're not interrupting anything.

170
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:27,970
I'm free.

171
00:07:28,010 --> 00:07:28,900
I can talk.

172
00:07:28,910 --> 00:07:30,200
No I can talk.

173
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:31,630
Am I interrupting anything.

174
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:33,530
I am a little bit busy right now.

175
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:35,810
So if you are busy What can you do.

176
00:07:35,810 --> 00:07:37,960
Should you just say bye.

177
00:07:37,970 --> 00:07:39,510
No of course not.

178
00:07:39,530 --> 00:07:41,630
You could say Can I call you back.

179
00:07:41,690 --> 00:07:47,060
But if you want to be really polite and you want to do it well then you should instead of just saying

180
00:07:47,090 --> 00:07:48,640
can I call you back.

181
00:07:48,710 --> 00:07:55,790
Give us specific time say when you will call them back but don't state it as a positive thing like I

182
00:07:55,790 --> 00:07:57,070
will do this.

183
00:07:57,170 --> 00:08:03,830
Make sure to confirm it because if I say I will call you back in five minutes maybe you're not free

184
00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:07,730
in five minutes so it's better to confirm with a question.

185
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:09,120
So I'm.

186
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:16,640
We could say I'm a bit tied up at the moment now to be very polite could I.

187
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:19,210
Or can I call you back.

188
00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:22,250
Call you back in 10 minutes.

189
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:24,290
Can I call you back in 10 minutes.

190
00:08:24,290 --> 00:08:29,000
This is a very polite way and a very common way to make sure the other person would be free at that

191
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:29,570
time.

192
00:08:29,570 --> 00:08:32,360
If you just say Can I call you back and you don't say when.

193
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:35,810
That makes the other person feel like you never will call them back.

194
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:40,970
If you say I will call you back in 10 minutes then the other person feels like you don't care about

195
00:08:40,970 --> 00:08:45,230
their time you don't respect their time so do it this way.

196
00:08:45,230 --> 00:08:56,780
Could I call you back in 10 minutes or is is it okay if I call you back in 15.

197
00:08:56,780 --> 00:09:02,090
Sometimes you just say 15 and we don't even say minutes because it can't be seconds and it can't be

198
00:09:02,090 --> 00:09:03,080
hours right.

199
00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:04,600
We know it's minutes.

200
00:09:04,610 --> 00:09:05,870
Can I call you back in 15.

201
00:09:05,870 --> 00:09:06,720
Yeah sure.

202
00:09:06,810 --> 00:09:10,610
And I can just say sure sure means yes of course.

203
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:17,570
OK so that's a very common way to make sure the other person is free before you actually do the invitation.

204
00:09:17,570 --> 00:09:23,480
It's sort of like step two step one small talk step to make sure the other person is able to spend the

205
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:25,990
couple minutes talking with you on the phone.

206
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,970
It's pretty polite then when they want to know what you're calling about.

207
00:09:29,990 --> 00:09:32,170
If you don't say it you should say it.

208
00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:33,850
You should say why you're calling.

209
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:35,230
Yeah yeah I'm free.

210
00:09:35,330 --> 00:09:39,090
Then you should say it but they might also say what's up.

211
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:45,940
Now this What's up means Why are you calling me so you could say are you free to talk now.

212
00:09:46,190 --> 00:09:48,550
Yeah I'm free to talk or Yeah I can talk.

213
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:49,850
What's up.

214
00:09:49,850 --> 00:09:50,870
What's up.

215
00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:52,030
Why are you calling me.

216
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:55,770
It would be weird to say why are you calling me so we'll say instead.

217
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:56,630
What's up.

218
00:09:56,630 --> 00:10:00,280
Then we get to the actual invitation.
