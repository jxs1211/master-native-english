1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:06,690
When people ask you to do things they want to hang out with you by the way hang out just means to do

2
00:00:06,690 --> 00:00:07,940
something together.

3
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:14,430
Often in a very casual way or go over to someone's house and just be there maybe play video games together

4
00:00:14,430 --> 00:00:19,250
or whatever talk if people ask you to do things and you can't or you don't want to.

5
00:00:19,290 --> 00:00:20,380
And you need to say no.

6
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:25,590
You have to know how to do that politely because if you just say no it's rude it's rude.

7
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:27,330
You can't just say no.

8
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:31,900
You have to say it in a certain way so we're gonna go over a couple of expressions.

9
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:35,750
We can use to say no baseline OK.

10
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:40,610
If I offer you a piece of candy and you want to say no to that fine.

11
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:45,330
Hey you want a piece of candy care for a piece of candy.

12
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:47,490
No no thanks.

13
00:00:47,490 --> 00:00:49,920
No thanks or no they're fine.

14
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:53,280
You can also say I'm good I'm good.

15
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:54,360
Means no.

16
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:55,380
Do you need anything.

17
00:00:55,380 --> 00:00:56,970
I'm going out to the supermarket.

18
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:03,180
I'm good I'm good very polite but when it comes to refusing an invitation that's kind of a bigger thing

19
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:03,540
right.

20
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:08,240
So we can't just say no thanks and we can't just say no.

21
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:09,670
We should say a little bit more.

22
00:01:09,670 --> 00:01:11,190
And it depends on the situation.

23
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:13,780
So let's go through these phrases.

24
00:01:13,780 --> 00:01:15,430
I'd love to but.

25
00:01:15,850 --> 00:01:18,220
So if you're being honest this is a good one.

26
00:01:18,220 --> 00:01:20,860
Maybe you really want to and maybe you really can't.

27
00:01:20,860 --> 00:01:27,550
You're so busy this week is just crazy hectic it's hectic hectic means really busy.

28
00:01:27,550 --> 00:01:33,430
I'd love to but this week is just totally hectic my whole week is booked.

29
00:01:33,430 --> 00:01:34,970
I don't think I can go.

30
00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:37,160
I'd love to but I can't.

31
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:37,490
All right.

32
00:01:37,690 --> 00:01:39,240
I just can't I'm too busy.

33
00:01:39,250 --> 00:01:42,680
Then you can say next time I wish I could.

34
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:49,930
I wish I could but I really wish I could but I have to be in the office until 10:00 p.m. tonight.

35
00:01:49,930 --> 00:01:50,890
So I really can't.

36
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:52,980
I wish I could but I can't.

37
00:01:53,110 --> 00:01:54,100
I wish I could.

38
00:01:54,310 --> 00:02:01,120
I wish I could have dinner tonight but I'm actually leaving to drive to my hometown and it's a seven

39
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:03,580
hour drive so I have to leave earlier.

40
00:02:03,580 --> 00:02:04,360
I wish I could.

41
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:06,670
I wish I could but I need to.

42
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:13,750
I need to leave at 3 p.m. Now of course in many situations people will tell a little tiny little what

43
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:21,790
we would call white lie and this is where we really don't have something to do or maybe we're just going

44
00:02:21,790 --> 00:02:23,390
to go home and hang out.

45
00:02:23,530 --> 00:02:24,820
We just don't want to go.

46
00:02:24,970 --> 00:02:25,140
Right.

47
00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:28,170
So we could say I'd love to but I really can't then.

48
00:02:28,310 --> 00:02:30,930
And this happens and if you want to do this you can.

49
00:02:30,970 --> 00:02:34,200
You could say I've got other plans.

50
00:02:34,190 --> 00:02:36,080
I I'd love to but I can't.

51
00:02:36,130 --> 00:02:44,600
I've got plans or I've got other plans I've got other things going on now.

52
00:02:44,610 --> 00:02:51,230
Those plans could be sitting at home and watching a movie sitting at home just watching Netflix or whatever.

53
00:02:52,090 --> 00:02:55,050
So you do have plans but they're not plans with other people.

54
00:02:55,060 --> 00:02:56,200
That's OK.

55
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:56,500
Right.

56
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:57,890
Saying I've got plans.

57
00:02:57,940 --> 00:03:00,230
It's better than saying no no.

58
00:03:00,270 --> 00:03:03,920
If you just don't feel like it you can say that directly.

59
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:12,490
But we often make it softer by saying not really I'm not really up to it I'm not really up to it or

60
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:16,060
I'm not really in the mood if we say I'm not in the mood.

61
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:18,230
It sounds a little bit moody.

62
00:03:18,370 --> 00:03:25,360
It sounds a little bit kind of grumpy grumpy means a bit angry a bit grumpy so we say I'm not really

63
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:26,130
in the mood.

64
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:31,650
It softens it saying not really is a way to make it sound a little less direct.

65
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:35,430
Or we could say I don't really feel like it.

66
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:41,770
I don't really don't really feel really.

67
00:03:42,190 --> 00:03:43,320
I don't really feel like it.

68
00:03:43,330 --> 00:03:45,760
I don't really feel like it unfortunately.

69
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:50,440
Maybe it's a time thing maybe it's just because you really don't have time.

70
00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:56,610
Hey I'm gonna go grab some dinner at about 7 o'clock.

71
00:03:56,620 --> 00:03:57,700
Do you want to go along.

72
00:03:57,790 --> 00:03:58,180
Yeah.

73
00:03:58,210 --> 00:03:58,420
Yeah.

74
00:03:58,420 --> 00:03:59,290
Sounds great.

75
00:03:59,290 --> 00:03:59,800
Sounds great.

76
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:00,370
I'd love to.

77
00:04:00,370 --> 00:04:01,510
What time.

78
00:04:01,510 --> 00:04:06,240
Seven to seven doesn't really work for me.

79
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:09,480
I'm going to be in the office until 8:00.

80
00:04:09,490 --> 00:04:12,570
Could we push it back to 8:00.

81
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:14,350
Or could we push it to 8:00.

82
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:16,690
Or how about 8:00.

83
00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:19,690
So when you want to check the time we often use.

84
00:04:19,690 --> 00:04:21,910
Work for.

85
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:22,330
Yeah.

86
00:04:22,330 --> 00:04:27,630
We use work for to ask whether a time is OK for another person.

87
00:04:27,730 --> 00:04:29,890
Does seven work for you.

88
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:35,680
Does does seven work for you.

89
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:36,730
Sounds weird right.

90
00:04:36,730 --> 00:04:40,530
We say it to seven worked for you now seven doesn't really work for me.

91
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:41,590
How about 8:00.

92
00:04:41,590 --> 00:04:43,240
Or could we push it to 8:00.

93
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:45,480
Could we move it to 9:00.

94
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:47,640
Or could we move it to tomorrow.

95
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:49,840
Also very very common.

96
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:54,160
So those are the common ways that we refuse if somebody asks us to do something.

97
00:04:54,190 --> 00:04:57,630
It's actually harder to refuse than to agree.

98
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:59,700
Because if you want to agree again you just say yeah.

99
00:04:59,710 --> 00:05:00,040
Great.

100
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:00,730
Sounds good.

101
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:02,180
Absolutely fantastic.

102
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:02,530
Yeah.

103
00:05:02,570 --> 00:05:03,810
OK right.

104
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:04,860
That's easy.

105
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:07,990
Now I did mention before ways to agree.

106
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:13,390
So we know those but I wanted to just review them and have them clearly written down so that they're

107
00:05:13,390 --> 00:05:20,170
easier to remember and also talk about how we can show a little bit less excitement if we need to.

108
00:05:20,170 --> 00:05:23,850
So as I mentioned before someone invites you to do something.

109
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:26,340
Want to go grab a cup of coffee.

110
00:05:26,350 --> 00:05:27,760
Sounds great.

111
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:29,920
Me and some friends are going out later tonight.

112
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:31,510
Would you care to come along.

113
00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:32,030
Sure.

114
00:05:32,050 --> 00:05:34,240
What time to get the time right.

115
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,160
Absolutely.

116
00:05:35,230 --> 00:05:36,680
Absolutely.

117
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:41,090
I'm thinking about going to get a sandwich for lunch.

118
00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:43,180
You want to go with me.

119
00:05:43,190 --> 00:05:43,940
Absolutely.

120
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:45,070
I'd love to.

121
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:45,740
I'll be there.

122
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:47,810
I'll be there is usually for more of a party.

123
00:05:47,810 --> 00:05:53,810
Hey I'm having a party this weekend on Friday and I'm wondering if you'd like to go.

124
00:05:53,810 --> 00:05:57,520
I'm wondering if is by the way also very common.

125
00:05:57,530 --> 00:06:07,620
I'm wondering if you'd you would you'd you'd like to to come you'd like to join us.

126
00:06:07,670 --> 00:06:15,260
I'm wondering if is a very common way as well to sound like it's it's great if you do but no pressure.

127
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:15,610
Right.

128
00:06:15,630 --> 00:06:18,310
Wondering if you'd like to I'll be there.

129
00:06:18,530 --> 00:06:19,410
I'll be there.

130
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:20,990
I'll be there.

131
00:06:20,990 --> 00:06:26,290
You can use to express that you're excited about going but only for party situations.

132
00:06:26,330 --> 00:06:32,180
If if I want to eat dinner with you and it's just you and me and you say I'll be there.

133
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:36,060
Maybe that's a little bit weird because it's just you and I.

134
00:06:36,170 --> 00:06:36,440
Right.

135
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:42,020
So usually I'll be there as for more of a social thing where there are more people a group of people

136
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:45,420
together three or four people or 20 or 30 people.

137
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:46,850
I'll be there.

138
00:06:46,850 --> 00:06:47,620
All right.

139
00:06:47,660 --> 00:06:51,590
Is often a little bit less excited but it depends on how you say it.

140
00:06:51,590 --> 00:06:52,910
If you say all right.

141
00:06:52,910 --> 00:06:53,920
All right.

142
00:06:53,990 --> 00:07:00,230
So I'm very excited if you say all right if you're gonna do this you roll your eyes roll your eyes.

143
00:07:00,230 --> 00:07:01,150
All right.

144
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:05,190
That means maybe you don't really want to go but you're agreeing anyway.

145
00:07:05,350 --> 00:07:06,980
OK why not.

146
00:07:06,980 --> 00:07:07,940
OK why not.

147
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:08,300
OK.

148
00:07:08,330 --> 00:07:09,010
Why not.

149
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:13,030
This doesn't mean you're excited it just means you're agreeing OK.

150
00:07:13,070 --> 00:07:14,300
Is like that.

151
00:07:14,420 --> 00:07:17,410
Yes it's positive but it's not excited.

152
00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:22,580
And then why not means you can't think of another reason or another thing you have to do.

153
00:07:22,610 --> 00:07:24,790
You can't think of a reason to say no.

154
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:27,170
So this does not sound excited.

155
00:07:27,170 --> 00:07:27,810
Sure.

156
00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:30,020
I've got nothing else going on.

157
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:33,830
It's a little weird but people do say it quite often.

158
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:39,950
It means I can't think of anything else I should do so yeah I guess I will.

159
00:07:39,950 --> 00:07:41,250
And people will say I.

160
00:07:41,450 --> 00:07:46,250
I guess so I guess so really expresses that you're not excited.

161
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:48,290
You wouldn't say I guess so.

162
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:54,560
People say I guess so I will but I'm not super excited about it.

163
00:07:54,560 --> 00:08:03,680
These are all extremely common ways to say yes at different levels of excitement or enthusiasm.
