1
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:11,610
In the last lesson we talked about tenses basically how we change verbs in time and that's very important.

2
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:18,720
That's really important to understand but we also need to begin to use English in real situations.

3
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:24,730
We need to be able to apply it to things we need to do in real life.

4
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:29,200
So in this lesson we're going to talk about how to invite people to do something.

5
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:35,190
We're going to go through lots of examples and we're going to frame this around a phone call because

6
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:37,820
that just helps us make it pretty simple.

7
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:40,110
We're gonna do it as a single phone call.

8
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:44,490
One friend inviting another friend to go out to eat.

9
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:51,540
That will be basically our situation and we're gonna go through lots of words and phrases and the steps

10
00:00:51,630 --> 00:00:57,690
of the call how it usually happens basically the things we learn in this lesson I want to be very clear

11
00:00:57,690 --> 00:01:00,410
can be used in lots of other situations.

12
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:06,600
And just because we learn something doesn't mean that's the only way this can be done.

13
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:08,310
There are many ways to invite.

14
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:14,270
There are many phrases that we will not learn today that you can use which are also correct.

15
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:17,090
So I just want to be clear about that first.

16
00:01:17,090 --> 00:01:25,830
OK now I also understand that nowadays most people invite other people on you know Facebook Messenger

17
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:28,370
or whatever app you use.

18
00:01:28,370 --> 00:01:28,630
Right.

19
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:35,240
You don't actually call somebody on the phone very often and ask them to go somewhere with you.

20
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:42,630
Probably but it's still a basic skill and you can use the same thing in person and in fact you can use

21
00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:45,140
the same thing in a text message as well.

22
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:49,360
Maybe it's a little different but the basic ideas are the same.

23
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:54,960
We're gonna talk about how at the beginning of a call you need to have a small talk and then we'll go

24
00:01:54,960 --> 00:02:01,440
into making sure the person at the other end is actually available right now to talk to you and how

25
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:03,780
we actually handle that situation.

26
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:09,870
Then we actually ask the other person if they would like to do something we'll do it in a way that's

27
00:02:09,870 --> 00:02:16,470
realistic not in a very fake way like I would like you to go with me or I would like to invite you to

28
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:17,920
blah blah blah.

29
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:19,280
Actually not very common.

30
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:24,990
Well we'll use some real natural words and phrases to invite someone to eat and then we'll talk about

31
00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:31,920
how we can say no without being really rude and how we can say yes and show different levels of excitement

32
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:38,370
and then finally we'll talk about how we can talk about where we're going to eat and confirm where we're

33
00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:38,970
going to go.
