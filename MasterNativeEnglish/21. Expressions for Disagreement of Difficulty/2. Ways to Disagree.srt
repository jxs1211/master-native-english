00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:07,080
So let's just get started and talk about some phrases we can use to disagree how we can actually express

2
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:10,280
our disagreement and there are a couple of simple ways we can do it.

3
00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:15,750
There are many many possibilities many possible ways but we're going to go through a couple of common

4
00:00:16,110 --> 00:00:19,210
phrases common phrases.

5
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:27,930
One is that we don't we don't see eye to eye.

6
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:32,060
If you think about it the phrase eye to eye does make sense.

7
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:33,630
My eyes lined up with your eye.

8
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:35,500
We kind of have the same view.

9
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:37,690
So you can kind of understand the idea.

10
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:43,920
It means if we say we don't see eye to eye that we have a different opinion so let's say two parents

11
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:46,650
disagree about how to raise their children.

12
00:00:46,650 --> 00:00:53,130
I think our son should study after class many many extra curricular activities.

13
00:00:53,130 --> 00:00:55,400
I think he should take a lot of extra classes.

14
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:57,120
The other parent says I disagree.

15
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:58,030
I don't think so.

16
00:00:58,080 --> 00:00:59,720
We should give him more free time.

17
00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:00,660
Let him play more.

18
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:02,450
We just don't see eye to eye.

19
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:06,660
And maybe she's saying that maybe the wife is saying that to her friends maybe the husband is saying

20
00:01:06,660 --> 00:01:08,550
it to his friends later.

21
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:11,410
We don't see eye to eye about this thing.

22
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:12,140
We disagree.

23
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:17,310
Very common phrase if you do agree can you say we see eye to eye if you can.

24
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:19,730
I think we see eye to eye on this.

25
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:23,810
I think we are pretty much eye to eye on this issue.

26
00:01:23,830 --> 00:01:33,970
OK my my opinion or view couldn't be more different my opinion or view couldn't be more different.

27
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:39,420
But this is really useful if we want to express that our opinion is so far away from the other person

28
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:47,010
that it's like the opposite end of the spectrum a spectrum is when you have one side all the way over

29
00:01:47,010 --> 00:01:53,310
here and this is maybe plus and one side all the way over here and this is minus and then some space

30
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:58,660
in between and the space in between is kind of fuzzy.

31
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:00,350
You know this is right in the middle.

32
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:05,060
This is closer to plus this is closer to minus but it's a kind of a mix.

33
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:11,250
OK so if I say my opinion or view couldn't be more different that means I'm way over here and you're

34
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:15,960
way over here opposite ends of the spectrum of opinion.

35
00:02:16,350 --> 00:02:18,690
If you're here then it could be more different.

36
00:02:18,690 --> 00:02:21,510
In fact should we say that it could.

37
00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:24,720
It could be more different my opinion could be more different.

38
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:27,460
No we don't usually use that expression.

39
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:33,650
We generally will say I couldn't disagree more but we could also say I couldn't agree more.

40
00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:40,170
So sometimes if we're completely on the same page completely on the same page that means we totally

41
00:02:40,170 --> 00:02:41,170
agree.

42
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:44,950
I couldn't agree more or it's the opposite.

43
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,170
My opinion couldn't be more different.

44
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:54,300
Now what if we want to make it softer because we don't always want to express that we have a very different

45
00:02:54,300 --> 00:03:02,250
view from from other people and we might want to show that we have some differences but it's not extreme

46
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:04,020
it's not very strong.

47
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:06,690
Well we could say this is very soft.

48
00:03:06,690 --> 00:03:14,420
I'm I'm not sure I see it that way.

49
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:20,600
You could also say I don't think I don't think I see it that way.

50
00:03:20,610 --> 00:03:22,170
I just don't see it that way.

51
00:03:22,230 --> 00:03:28,620
If you want to make it very very gentle very gentle very soft very indirect you could say I'm not sure.

52
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:30,380
I'm just not sure I see it that way.

53
00:03:30,470 --> 00:03:35,760
OK so for example where colleagues and one person says well you know what.

54
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:38,950
I think that we should never have to work overtime.

55
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:42,940
We're here to work 40 hours a week 40 hours a week no more.

56
00:03:43,110 --> 00:03:49,500
And another person who wants to maybe add more contribute more so that maybe the company will be more

57
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:50,340
successful.

58
00:03:50,490 --> 00:03:54,440
Maybe we'll say very politely I'm not sure I see it that way.

59
00:03:54,450 --> 00:04:00,470
I think if we work overtime the whole company will be more productive and we're getting paid and we're

60
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:01,230
getting paid.

61
00:04:01,230 --> 00:04:06,150
Common expressions see eye to eye or don't see eye to eye.

62
00:04:06,210 --> 00:04:11,990
I couldn't agree more or my opinion couldn't be more different.

63
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,240
I'm not sure I see it that way.

64
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:15,900
I'm not sure I see it that way.

65
00:04:16,020 --> 00:04:16,320
OK.

66
00:04:16,350 --> 00:04:19,440
Let's move on and actually look at a compromise.

67
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:25,410
We'll talk about what that means and also some phrases that we can use to express compromise.
