1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:07,290
All right now let's actually look at a compromise situation where two people disagree about the price

2
00:00:07,590 --> 00:00:08,520
of a car.

3
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:12,850
We've done this a little bit before when we were talking about the apartment.

4
00:00:12,930 --> 00:00:19,650
But I want to make sure we look at the situation with some of the phrases that we've talked about so

5
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:20,190
far.

6
00:00:20,190 --> 00:00:20,480
OK.

7
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:25,630
So on the Web site this is the buyer the person who might buy the car.

8
00:00:25,630 --> 00:00:29,070
And this is the this is the seller.

9
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:29,950
This is the seller.

10
00:00:30,010 --> 00:00:32,240
OK here we go on the website.

11
00:00:32,260 --> 00:00:36,520
The car is listed for five thousand eight hundred.

12
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:38,890
That means that's the price that it says on the Web site.

13
00:00:39,190 --> 00:00:42,310
But I think that's a little steep.

14
00:00:42,310 --> 00:00:43,090
That's a little steep.

15
00:00:43,090 --> 00:00:44,410
By the way we could say here.

16
00:00:44,410 --> 00:00:46,030
Fifty eight hundred.

17
00:00:46,030 --> 00:00:51,100
Sometimes people say fifty eight hundred fifty eight hundred dollars but five thousand eight hundred

18
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:52,610
dollars is more common.

19
00:00:52,630 --> 00:00:58,470
Steep means too expensive given how many miles are on it.

20
00:00:58,510 --> 00:01:02,110
I think five thousand two hundred dollars would be fair.

21
00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:03,550
So this is the offer.

22
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:03,840
OK.

23
00:01:03,850 --> 00:01:06,610
This is the offer the low offer.

24
00:01:06,610 --> 00:01:08,400
I just don't see it that way.

25
00:01:08,410 --> 00:01:10,710
I just don't see it that way.

26
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:12,810
We could say I don't quite see it that way.

27
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:14,530
We don't have to say it like that.

28
00:01:14,530 --> 00:01:18,420
As I said the car has been kept in excellent condition.

29
00:01:18,430 --> 00:01:25,480
In fact I think this car could go for six thousand dollars.

30
00:01:25,540 --> 00:01:26,570
Go for means.

31
00:01:26,590 --> 00:01:29,650
That's the price that some people might be willing to pay.

32
00:01:29,650 --> 00:01:35,890
Sometimes we use go for when we're talking about the amount that you could sell something a little more

33
00:01:35,890 --> 00:01:37,480
expensive for.

34
00:01:37,630 --> 00:01:44,800
We don't usually use it for small things like candy or bottles of water but for things like houses and

35
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:51,790
cars and sometimes clothes sometimes we can use go for I can't believe that these go for fifty eight

36
00:01:51,790 --> 00:01:52,750
dollars.

37
00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:54,940
These shoes go for fifty eight dollars.

38
00:01:54,940 --> 00:01:56,210
It's so expensive.

39
00:01:56,220 --> 00:01:57,400
OK go for.

40
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:57,610
All right.

41
00:01:57,610 --> 00:02:00,090
Let's go to the next part of this negotiation.

42
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:02,650
So far we've used this phrase.

43
00:02:02,650 --> 00:02:04,620
I just don't see it that way.

44
00:02:04,630 --> 00:02:06,040
I just don't see it that way.

45
00:02:06,130 --> 00:02:06,550
OK.

46
00:02:06,610 --> 00:02:16,180
Then the buyer says it's just so far out of my price range too expensive so far out of my price range.

47
00:02:16,210 --> 00:02:20,690
Would you be willing to consider five thousand three hundred dollars.

48
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:22,510
Would you be willing to consider.

49
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:24,230
So it's another offer.

50
00:02:24,230 --> 00:02:25,590
One hundred dollars more.

51
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:27,090
There's another phrase.

52
00:02:27,490 --> 00:02:33,600
I'll tell you what this is when the seller is going to show that he or she is ready to compromise.

53
00:02:33,610 --> 00:02:39,610
I'll tell you what means I'm going to give you a better deal now if you can pay in cash.

54
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:45,280
I could do five thousand six hundred do that if you can do something.

55
00:02:45,310 --> 00:02:47,370
It's like saying that works for me.

56
00:02:47,450 --> 00:02:50,590
Hey I want to meet around 4 o'clock.

57
00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:52,080
Does that work for you.

58
00:02:52,090 --> 00:02:52,290
Yeah.

59
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:53,270
That works for me.

60
00:02:53,290 --> 00:02:55,880
Or you can say Yeah I can do for.

61
00:02:55,930 --> 00:02:57,320
I can do for.

62
00:02:57,340 --> 00:02:58,000
That's fine.

63
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:58,930
I can do that.

64
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:01,410
I could do five thousand six hundred dollars.

65
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:06,400
I can pay cash fine if you can meet me in the middle on the price.

66
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:09,160
Meet me in the middle on the price.

67
00:03:09,170 --> 00:03:11,380
So two people on two ends.

68
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:14,430
Five thousand four hundred five thousand four hundred.

69
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:15,770
That would be about the middle.

70
00:03:15,790 --> 00:03:16,030
Right.

71
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:23,240
Meet me in the middle on the price then maybe the seller will say Oh OK OK you've got a deal.

72
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:25,600
You got a deal.

73
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:27,930
You've got yourself a deal sometimes.

74
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:33,130
So we've used some of the phrases for how we can negotiate and more importantly compromise when we're

75
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:35,080
ready to give up something.

76
00:03:35,110 --> 00:03:41,380
It's very important in many conversations you have this opinion they have this opinion it's necessary

77
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:45,240
to sometimes give up a few of your ideas.

78
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:53,140
A few of the things you want in order to make other people happy and come to a solution to your problems.

79
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:53,620
All right.

80
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:59,800
We're going to go on and talk about some difficulty and how we can describe some difficulties.
