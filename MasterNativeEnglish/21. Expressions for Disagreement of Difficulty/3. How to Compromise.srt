1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:02,460
OK so what is a compromise.

2
00:00:02,460 --> 00:00:07,980
Well you may already know but basically a compromise is when two people who disagree about something

3
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:15,120
find a space in the middle where one side gives up something and the other side gives up something so

4
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:20,470
that they can agree so that they can come to some sort of agreement.

5
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:27,630
So the parent who wants their son to study a lot after school is over here the parent who wants their

6
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:31,410
son to have a lot of free time after school is over here.

7
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:34,400
Well they need to meet in the middle.

8
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:37,320
It's not going to be only this or only this.

9
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:43,200
They need to find somewhere in the middle in this spectrum where they agree so that they can actually

10
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:44,190
get somewhere.

11
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:44,760
Right.

12
00:00:44,790 --> 00:00:47,610
So they have to find common ground.

13
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:53,480
This space in the middle between the two extremes of the spectrum.

14
00:00:53,530 --> 00:00:54,770
This is the spectrum.

15
00:00:54,810 --> 00:00:57,260
This area is common ground.

16
00:00:57,270 --> 00:01:04,860
Maybe if our son takes four classes a week for extra classes a week then you'll still have time to hang

17
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:05,870
out with friends.

18
00:01:05,890 --> 00:01:12,570
OK I could agree to three or four classes a week as long as he can do things he enjoys more creative

19
00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:14,530
things three times a week.

20
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:15,180
Yes OK.

21
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:16,290
That sounds fair.

22
00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:17,770
So they're in here.

23
00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:19,730
Not on the extremes.

24
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:22,910
They have found common ground.

25
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:24,080
They've met in the middle.

26
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:24,810
They have.

27
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:26,980
And this can be a noun or a verb.

28
00:01:26,980 --> 00:01:29,040
It can be a noun or a verb.

29
00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:34,080
They have made they have made a compromise.

30
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:39,420
They have they have compromised and that's a verb they have made a compromise.

31
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:41,560
They have compromised.

32
00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:44,220
OK so that's the meaning of compromise.

33
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:48,760
Now we can look at a couple of expressions when we're ready to compromise.

34
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:49,090
OK.

35
00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:50,600
So let's look at a few of those.

36
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:56,370
Now let's take that situation with the two parents who want to compromise.

37
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:59,930
They have two different views on an issue and they want to compromise.

38
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:03,450
Well one parent might say I'll tell you what I'll tell you what.

39
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:06,240
So this is a way to suggest the compromise.

40
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:07,970
The thing that you're willing to give up.

41
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:15,150
Tell you what if he can take three classes a week and also play with his friends a few times a week

42
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,150
then I think we have a deal.

43
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:18,110
I think we can agree.

44
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:23,650
Let's talk about a seller for example a seller wants to sell something a buyer wants to buy something.

45
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:26,250
Seller is giving a very high price.

46
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:29,250
Buyer doesn't want to pay a high price.

47
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:32,020
They want to pay a low price obviously.

48
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:32,690
OK.

49
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:36,270
So they are at opposite ends of the spectrum.

50
00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:42,180
But the person in the shop who wants to buy something has made it very clear they don't want to pay

51
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:43,710
the full price.

52
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:45,200
They think it's too high.

53
00:02:45,210 --> 00:02:49,060
The seller is ready to compromise to give up a little bit.

54
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:51,990
So the seller might say Well I'll tell you what.

55
00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:58,710
Instead of 400 How about 350 we use How about as a way to recommend the new price.

56
00:02:58,710 --> 00:02:59,670
It's very common.

57
00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:02,250
And we'll look at another situation in a moment.

58
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:03,360
How about this.

59
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:08,010
How about this three hundred fifty and I'll give you a free.

60
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:10,560
Whatever and something.

61
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:14,200
How about this is to recommend it to suggest the new thing.

62
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:19,380
The compromise would you be willing to consider three hundred three hundred.

63
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:23,210
That's my final offer although that wouldn't really be a compromise if you added that.

64
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:30,520
But sometimes people say that final offer in a negotiation when you're bargaining with the seller.

65
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:36,390
Bargaining with the seller would you be willing to consider this if you want to get somebody to do something

66
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:38,320
you can recommend it in this way.

67
00:03:38,370 --> 00:03:42,780
Would you be willing to consider helping me move my sofa tomorrow.

68
00:03:42,810 --> 00:03:44,880
Would you be willing to consider that.

69
00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:47,830
It's very very polite very gentle.

70
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:48,210
OK.

71
00:03:48,210 --> 00:03:50,600
Could you meet me in the middle on this.

72
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:57,730
Now this one may not be used so much when it comes to price in a shop.

73
00:03:57,730 --> 00:04:00,450
Media could you could say could you meet me in the middle on this.

74
00:04:00,450 --> 00:04:02,520
I think 300 is fair.

75
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:04,230
350 is still too high.

76
00:04:04,230 --> 00:04:08,850
Could you meet me in the middle on this please.

77
00:04:08,850 --> 00:04:09,300
All right.

78
00:04:09,570 --> 00:04:11,070
All right I guess so.

79
00:04:11,130 --> 00:04:12,250
You've got a deal.

80
00:04:12,350 --> 00:04:13,050
OK.

81
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:19,500
Maybe maybe but I think this one is probably more common for situations more like the husband and the

82
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:21,930
wife who disagree about their child.

83
00:04:21,930 --> 00:04:27,670
Listen I just don't want him to be in class all day including after school.

84
00:04:27,690 --> 00:04:30,650
I think it's reasonable that he should have some free time.

85
00:04:30,690 --> 00:04:32,970
Could you meet me in the middle on this.

86
00:04:32,970 --> 00:04:34,740
Let's find some common ground.

87
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:35,010
OK.

88
00:04:35,010 --> 00:04:41,850
Now a couple more expressions we can use when we're in this sort of bargaining negotiation type situation

89
00:04:42,030 --> 00:04:44,510
negotiating by the way is what we're doing.

90
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:46,000
We are negotiating.

91
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:51,420
If it's money that we're dealing with then we're bargaining we're bargaining when we're talking about

92
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:57,320
money especially in a shop sometimes haggling but usually bargaining.

93
00:04:57,330 --> 00:04:59,490
I think what I'm asking is reasonable.

94
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:02,200
Now this is just a comment.

95
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:06,810
This is just a thing to say to sort of support the number you gave.

96
00:05:06,830 --> 00:05:08,650
So four classes a week.

97
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:12,090
I think what I'm asking is is reasonable don't you.

98
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:14,160
Then the other side has to say something.

99
00:05:14,210 --> 00:05:15,040
Yes or no.

100
00:05:15,050 --> 00:05:16,050
Probably.

101
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:16,750
OK.

102
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:25,910
I'm not saying we have to do it my way or only my way but I think for example if one parent wants the

103
00:05:26,390 --> 00:05:30,450
boy to take two classes every day after school.

104
00:05:30,590 --> 00:05:32,470
That would be my way.

105
00:05:32,510 --> 00:05:37,420
That's my way My way is what I want what I think is right.

106
00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:39,560
In fact we have an interesting expression.

107
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:46,910
My way or the highway my way or the highway it's my way or the highway.

108
00:05:46,910 --> 00:05:55,160
That means if you don't agree with what I think is right with what I want to do leave get on the highway

109
00:05:55,190 --> 00:05:56,270
go away.

110
00:05:56,270 --> 00:05:57,320
It's like that.

111
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:58,760
It's my way or the highway.

112
00:05:58,910 --> 00:06:03,890
So when you're compromising you can't say that can't say my way or the highway.

113
00:06:03,950 --> 00:06:10,430
If you want to compromise so I'm not saying we have to do it my way or I'm not saying we have to do

114
00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:15,480
it only my way means I'm willing to be flexible here.

115
00:06:15,530 --> 00:06:20,070
But I think it is important that he take some classes.

116
00:06:20,090 --> 00:06:25,850
It's very important that he takes some classes so that he can stay ahead and compete with the other

117
00:06:25,850 --> 00:06:26,650
students.

118
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:30,320
So this one is really good for negotiating in situations.

119
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:36,970
We are talking about actions what should be done not usually about price and when you're ready to compromise.

120
00:06:37,070 --> 00:06:43,700
You can use these phrases to kind of support your side and and sort of explain your side to show that

121
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:47,600
what you're saying is reasonable it's reasonable very reasonable.
