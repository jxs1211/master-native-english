00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:09,750
In the last lesson we talked about how to give presentations and I hope that you've actually tried to

2
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:15,540
give your own presentation to practice all the things that we learned in this lesson we're going to

3
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:23,550
talk about difficulty how we can handle or deal with difficulty or disagreements if we don't disagree

4
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:29,310
with someone how do we describe that we're having a hard time how do we describe that so we're going

5
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:34,980
to learn quite a few new phrases in this lesson we're also going to go through a couple of specific

6
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:43,200
situations so we'll look at an example of bargaining and how two people can talk back and forth to find

7
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:44,750
a compromise.

8
00:00:44,770 --> 00:00:51,210
I also want to talk about what a compromise is or when to learn a few phrases that we can use in compromise

9
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:54,920
situations or when we want to compromise.

10
00:00:55,230 --> 00:01:00,160
Finally we're going to practice a few ways that we can give suggestions different than giving advice.

11
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:04,490
We want to weigh in on someone's difficult choice.

12
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:05,800
We have a difficult choice.

13
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:12,510
We'll talk about how we can describe that difficult choice and then how other people can say well it's

14
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:15,130
better if you do this it's better if you do that.

15
00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:18,240
We call that weighing in sometimes.

16
00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:19,250
All right let's get started.
