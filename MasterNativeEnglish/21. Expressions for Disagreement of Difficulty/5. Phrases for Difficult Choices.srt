1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:06,540
So far in this lesson we've talked about how we can show disagreement with others either in a very polite

2
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:08,530
way or a more direct way.

3
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:13,060
And how when we have disagreements we can come to a compromise.

4
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:19,140
For example in a negotiation or when we need to bargain and how we can use phrases to express that we're

5
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:21,030
ready to give something up.

6
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:28,260
Now we're going to talk about another type of difficult situation a difficult choice and you have to

7
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:29,050
make a choice.

8
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:30,750
That's not fun.

9
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:36,870
There are two really common expressions and I want to teach you the two expressions because they are

10
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:38,630
very common and very useful.

11
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:42,430
And then we're going to actually look at some examples.

12
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:47,450
One of them could be a choice between two good things but it's difficult still.

13
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:47,960
Right.

14
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,550
But the two choices are good positive.

15
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:55,530
The other is definitely for bad things definitely for negative things.

16
00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:58,360
So let's learn these two and then look at the examples.

17
00:00:58,380 --> 00:01:02,740
Have you ever been in a situation where you have two choices.

18
00:01:02,790 --> 00:01:06,370
There's just so hard to make one or the other.

19
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:13,440
It may be that it's because this choice is not great in this choice is not great but it may often be

20
00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:19,770
because this choice is very good very attractive and this choice is very good very attractive choice

21
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:22,710
and choice B are both great choices.

22
00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:28,830
You don't know which one to go with which means choose to go with.

23
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:35,580
OK so on the fence is the expression I'm on the fence I'm on the fence.

24
00:01:35,580 --> 00:01:36,750
Well what what does that mean.

25
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:37,860
Let's break that down.

26
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:42,030
Well a fence is something that divides two things.

27
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:46,490
For example there's a home here with a yard and a home here with a yard.

28
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:50,380
Let me draw a very fast and very ugly home.

29
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:55,660
There's a home here a tree and a yard and.

30
00:01:56,330 --> 00:01:57,090
OK.

31
00:01:57,210 --> 00:02:00,340
And there's a home here and then the little tree.

32
00:02:00,410 --> 00:02:01,080
This one's bigger.

33
00:02:01,110 --> 00:02:04,590
Oh this bigger tree and a yard.

34
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:08,160
OK so two houses now in the middle.

35
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:10,600
In the middle there's a fence.

36
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:18,180
There's a fence here and it divides the two properties one property two properties.

37
00:02:18,210 --> 00:02:22,950
Now you can imagine walking on the fence right.

38
00:02:23,070 --> 00:02:25,990
If you're walking on the fence it takes great balance.

39
00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:33,810
We use this visual idea this visual idea to communicate that we don't know if we should fall off on

40
00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:36,720
this side or fall off on this side.

41
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:37,720
We don't know.

42
00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:46,740
That's why we're on the fence about whether to A or B whether to go with A or B.

43
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:55,790
I'm really on the fence about whether whether often I should do A or go with B.

44
00:02:55,830 --> 00:02:57,060
I just don't know.

45
00:02:57,060 --> 00:03:01,220
So let's look at an example we talked about the two houses.

46
00:03:01,230 --> 00:03:05,520
So we should have a pretty good idea about what on the fence means.

47
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:08,520
Let's actually look at a case where we can use it.

48
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:09,240
OK.

49
00:03:09,330 --> 00:03:14,330
I got offers from both talking about two two companies here.

50
00:03:14,410 --> 00:03:21,540
If you go to a job interview you apply to a company and you go to an interview and you do well maybe

51
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:26,820
you do that at two different companies and you get an offer that means they would like you to work for

52
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:27,170
them.

53
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:28,340
So that's a good thing.

54
00:03:28,410 --> 00:03:36,430
I got offers from both and I'm completely on the fence about which one to choose.

55
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:47,160
We could also remember say about whether to choose that or x box game company X Box offers great benefits

56
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:54,600
a great benefits package benefits are the extra things besides your salary basic things your salary

57
00:03:55,170 --> 00:04:01,080
your salary benefits are things like health insurance.

58
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:08,100
And sometimes sometimes we have an expense account which means you can have a credit card and you just

59
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:14,700
swipe it when you buy stuff an expense account anyway x box offers a great benefits package and the

60
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:17,230
pay is fantastic.

61
00:04:17,230 --> 00:04:19,590
That means the salary is fantastic.

62
00:04:19,590 --> 00:04:20,970
Those are two different things.

63
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:29,610
But Apple seems to have better long term prospects prospects in terms of promotions.

64
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:33,530
I could really go either way at this point and I could use some help.

65
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:36,360
So we would maybe give advice to this person.

66
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:39,360
Oh you poor you poor you.

67
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:45,620
You have the choice to work at two very good companies with a great salary and you can't choose.

68
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:51,150
Oh no I say follow your heart or go and live in a cave.

69
00:04:51,150 --> 00:04:51,440
OK.

70
00:04:51,630 --> 00:04:59,450
So here when we say in terms of promotions that means chances to get a better job in the future better

71
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:04,080
prospects means you have some good possibilities in the future.

72
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:09,210
If you're standing on a hill and you look out over the horizon your prospects are the things that are

73
00:05:09,210 --> 00:05:13,810
possible for you have no prospects.

74
00:05:14,370 --> 00:05:18,570
It could be for your relationships could be for your career often for a career.

75
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:22,140
So here's how we use on the fence.

76
00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:24,930
And usually it's for two good things.

77
00:05:24,930 --> 00:05:26,700
But again not always.

78
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:33,900
Now let's look at another expression which is very similar and can also express a difficult choice but

79
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:36,930
it is for two negative things.

80
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:45,270
The next expression for describing a difficult choice where both choices are bad is between a rock and

81
00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:46,970
a hard place.

82
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:54,450
Now this has a very interesting physical sort of visual description connected to it which helps us really

83
00:05:54,450 --> 00:05:55,790
understand it.

84
00:05:55,810 --> 00:06:03,750
There is a movie called One Hundred and twenty seven hours and it's about a man who goes hiking in.

85
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:06,200
He ends up in a canyon.

86
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:15,060
The rock wall came and there's a boulder which is a big stones Canyon is to two stone walls on both

87
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:16,010
sides of you.

88
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:21,990
We could also call it a crevice if it's smaller so maybe it's a crevice whatever and a Boulder is a

89
00:06:21,990 --> 00:06:22,940
big stone.

90
00:06:22,970 --> 00:06:23,450
OK.

91
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:32,400
And he gets his hand stuck between the rock and the wall and he can't get it out and he's there for

92
00:06:32,670 --> 00:06:33,590
days.

93
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,950
This is a true story.

94
00:06:35,130 --> 00:06:39,000
The movie is not the real thing but the story is real.

95
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:43,020
And he has to make a choice should I stay here and die.

96
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:43,730
That's choice.

97
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:50,690
A one choice a stay here and die from starvation or lack of water.

98
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:54,880
Choice B choice number two also not good.

99
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:56,440
Cut my hand off.

100
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:59,900
I have a very old not very sharp knife.

101
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:08,400
I would have to break the bone and cut my arm off because that's what stuck between the the wall and

102
00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:09,820
the the Boulder.

103
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:11,570
So there are two choices.

104
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:13,240
Both choices are terrible.

105
00:07:13,290 --> 00:07:16,080
So we say I'm between a rock and a hard place.

106
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:24,720
The interesting thing about this one is that he's actually between a rock this thing which is a rock

107
00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:27,240
and a hard place the wall.

108
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:31,850
So it's very physically meaningful to you can picture it very clearly I think.

109
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:33,240
Don't picture it too clearly.

110
00:07:33,270 --> 00:07:36,090
He ended up cutting his arm off by the way.

111
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:40,180
He survived but he had to cut his arm off very slowly.

112
00:07:40,530 --> 00:07:41,910
No fun.

113
00:07:41,970 --> 00:07:46,860
So we used this expression when we're in any kind of situation like this.

114
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:49,390
Two difficult choices to make.

115
00:07:49,410 --> 00:07:51,540
We don't know which one to choose.

116
00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:52,560
It's not fun.

117
00:07:52,650 --> 00:07:54,650
So let's look at an example.

118
00:07:54,690 --> 00:08:02,010
This example comes from a business owner someone who's owning a business and it's a small business.

119
00:08:02,070 --> 00:08:07,200
It's a shop to shop maybe a bookshop a coffee shop and it's not doing well.

120
00:08:07,710 --> 00:08:10,260
It's not doing very well not making very much money.

121
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:13,480
Maybe customers aren't coming in for some reason.

122
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:21,900
So the shop owner says if things aren't looking good either way either way means it could be that way

123
00:08:21,930 --> 00:08:23,310
or that way.

124
00:08:23,370 --> 00:08:24,850
Both options are bad.

125
00:08:24,870 --> 00:08:27,250
You could go either way means you could go this way.

126
00:08:27,270 --> 00:08:29,210
Go left go right.

127
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:31,840
Things aren't looking good either way.

128
00:08:31,890 --> 00:08:37,270
I could either close my shop and file for bankruptcy.

129
00:08:37,290 --> 00:08:44,850
Bankruptcy is when you basically announce formally legally that you cannot pay back money that you've

130
00:08:44,850 --> 00:08:45,720
borrowed.

131
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:52,320
And it's sort of like a restart on your financial situation file for bankruptcy or borrow more money

132
00:08:52,530 --> 00:08:56,370
and try to breathe new life into the business.

133
00:08:56,370 --> 00:09:06,410
This is another expression to breathe life into something is to to try to give it a fresh start or something

134
00:09:06,410 --> 00:09:09,590
new something fresh so that it can change.

135
00:09:09,650 --> 00:09:16,220
While that change in my diet really breathed new life into my daily routine I have much more energy

136
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:19,000
now be a simple example.

137
00:09:19,610 --> 00:09:24,260
I guess you could say I'm between a rock and a hard place.

138
00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:28,530
Or you could say I'm really between a rock and a hard place.

139
00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:33,240
Or you could just directly say I'm between a rock and a hard place.

140
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:40,510
So this one doesn't fit very well within the description of what the two bad choices are.

141
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:45,010
It's usually a sentence by itself unlike the other one.

142
00:09:45,170 --> 00:09:51,980
I'm on the fence because we say I'm on the fence about whether to a or b but this one.

143
00:09:51,980 --> 00:09:55,030
We say I'm between a rock and a hard place.

144
00:09:55,040 --> 00:10:01,070
I'm really between a rock and a hard place either at the beginning or the end of the description of

145
00:10:01,070 --> 00:10:02,290
what the two things are.

146
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:03,500
So it's used differently.

147
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:08,180
It's usually separated from the actual description.

148
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:16,730
So when we want to actually recommend what our friend should do in either situation either the on the

149
00:10:16,730 --> 00:10:24,290
fence situation with the two companies or the company that's about to go bankrupt unless the owner borrows

150
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:25,160
more money.

151
00:10:25,190 --> 00:10:28,400
How do we give advice to these people.

152
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:35,270
Well we can use the phrase best bet best bet as a way to say this is what I think would be the smartest

153
00:10:35,270 --> 00:10:44,360
choice it is most likely it is most likely the best choice when we're giving our opinion about something

154
00:10:44,630 --> 00:10:53,120
we might be talking about the probability of success or how likely it is that this idea is going to

155
00:10:53,120 --> 00:11:01,180
be the one that you should choose the one that works out in the long run.

156
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:03,590
Finally basically is the meaning.

157
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:12,470
OK so best bet your best bet is to your best bet is to let's look at the examples for the first situation.

158
00:11:12,470 --> 00:11:19,700
Your best bet would be to go with the company that has better long term prospects long term means not

159
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:24,590
not just now not just money now but in the far future go with.

160
00:11:24,590 --> 00:11:29,730
Remember go with means choose the company that has better long term prospects.

161
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:35,960
And again basically it means that's what I think is the smartest choice the most likely to be successful

162
00:11:36,110 --> 00:11:39,720
to be good for you in the long run.

163
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:46,820
In the second situation number two your best bet might be to hire a marketing team and try to revive

164
00:11:47,330 --> 00:11:55,050
the business revive means to bring it back to life it's almost dead to come back to life.

165
00:11:55,070 --> 00:11:56,160
Come back to life.

166
00:11:56,390 --> 00:11:57,740
Revive the business.

167
00:11:57,740 --> 00:12:02,830
If you give up now you may never get another shot at it.

168
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:09,390
This shot is another try another attempt another try another attempt at it.

169
00:12:09,410 --> 00:12:16,570
This may be your only chance to follow your dream of having a bookstore so your best bet.

170
00:12:16,580 --> 00:12:22,790
The smartest thing for you to do the thing that's most likely to lead to success for you is to hire

171
00:12:23,060 --> 00:12:24,190
a marketing team.

172
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:30,050
In this lesson we've learned quite a few new phrases for describing difficult situations and describing

173
00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:33,490
disagreement as well as compromise.

174
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:39,830
So what I'd like you to do is try to describe a situation in which you've had to make a difficult choice

175
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:41,050
a difficult choice.

176
00:12:41,210 --> 00:12:47,960
Try to describe both the pros the good things and the cons of both choices of the choices.

177
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:52,430
Record yourself so speak into your phone and then listen to it again.

178
00:12:52,460 --> 00:12:57,830
Make sure to use the expressions from this lesson and write down any mistakes you find so that you can

179
00:12:57,830 --> 00:13:04,880
become more aware of those mistakes so that you can hear them when you're seeing them next time.

180
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:05,330
Good luck.
