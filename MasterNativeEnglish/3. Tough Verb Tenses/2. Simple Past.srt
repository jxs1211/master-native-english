1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:02,430
OK so we'll start from the simplest thing.

2
00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:09,030
How we talk about something in the past when something happened before it's done it's finished and we

3
00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:14,070
don't really care about maybe the details of it happening before.

4
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:15,720
Another thing that happened.

5
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:17,720
There's just something that's that's finished.

6
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:19,470
We use what we call the simple past.

7
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:24,450
And when we do this we need to change verbs into the past tense.

8
00:00:24,450 --> 00:00:31,410
The only thing that's really hard about this is knowing that sometimes you add e d to words and sometimes

9
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:31,980
you don't.

10
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:37,980
And the best way to learn that is to just see many examples and get the feeling for it.

11
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:45,510
So make sure when you're watching movies or reading you pay attention to the different ways that verbs

12
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:47,690
are changed into the past tense.

13
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:52,910
But anyway just a couple of very simple examples I think you probably already know this.

14
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:55,390
So we'll we'll keep it really really basic.

15
00:00:55,410 --> 00:00:56,330
OK.

16
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:59,060
Actually you know what's the hardest part about this.

17
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:04,200
The hardest part I find with students who are learning English is remembering to do it.

18
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:09,990
For example maybe a student will say I run to the store I run to the store.

19
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:17,330
And then if I say you said I run to the store then the student will say I said run to the store I should

20
00:01:17,330 --> 00:01:22,260
have said I ran to the store and then I'll say But you didn't you said I run to the store and they go

21
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:22,940
Oh.

22
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:30,570
So actually the tough part for many learners of English is not knowing you know that ran that ran is

23
00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:35,130
the past tense for run and you probably know that.

24
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:39,410
But when you're speaking you're thinking about a lot of different things at the same time.

25
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:41,150
Which words should I use.

26
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:43,920
What things should be in the past and what things should not.

27
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:46,020
How do I fit this whole sentence together.

28
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:47,760
What am I going to talk about next.

29
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:52,310
And because you have so many things going on at the same time it's easy to make a mistake.

30
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:57,330
So when you're speaking you have to be very careful you have to pay attention to what's coming out of

31
00:01:57,330 --> 00:01:58,090
your mouth.

32
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:02,700
If to hear yourself and try to catch it and correct it right away.

33
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:06,910
And if you do that you can get into the habit of saying it the right way.

34
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:11,610
If you're always correcting yourself after you say it because you said the wrong thing and you heard

35
00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:16,030
yourself say it that's the first step then change it corrected.

36
00:02:16,350 --> 00:02:18,810
Then you can start doing it in your head.

37
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:23,020
You can start doing it in your head then you're OK.

38
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:25,170
You're expressing it correctly.

39
00:02:25,170 --> 00:02:25,430
OK.

40
00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:27,840
So I really pay attention.

41
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:33,060
Slow down when you're speaking not worry about speaking very quickly.

42
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:41,290
You don't have to speak quickly speak slowly and listen be aware of yourself awareness awareness.

43
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:44,310
Today is the day where I'm breaking words and half.

44
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:47,740
Awareness is the key to changing habits.

45
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:54,540
And one of the one of the worst speaking habits for English learners is not changing very simple verbs

46
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:55,710
into the past tense.

47
00:02:55,710 --> 00:02:59,840
So awareness is the key to changing speaking habits.

48
00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:04,010
So remember that for everything but especially for this lesson.

49
00:03:04,010 --> 00:03:04,710
OK.

50
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:05,970
So some examples.

51
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:07,030
Take walk.

52
00:03:07,350 --> 00:03:07,660
OK.

53
00:03:07,670 --> 00:03:09,370
Walk is E.D..

54
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:09,630
OK.

55
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:13,730
This is a regular one so to make walk the past tense we just add E.D..

56
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:14,480
No problem.

57
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:15,650
Very easy.

58
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:23,280
I it's super easy I walked I walked to work yesterday.

59
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,570
Piece of cake.

60
00:03:24,570 --> 00:03:26,280
That means something is very easy right.

61
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:27,520
It's a piece of cake.

62
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:29,010
I walked to work yesterday.

63
00:03:29,010 --> 00:03:31,170
Change that to E.D. and we're fine.

64
00:03:31,170 --> 00:03:31,820
No problem.

65
00:03:31,890 --> 00:03:32,560
OK.

66
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:36,180
How about find is find find it.

67
00:03:36,210 --> 00:03:37,020
No it's not.

68
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:39,980
So this one is not regular E.D..

69
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:43,590
This is what we would call irregular irregular.

70
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:45,870
So this would be found.

71
00:03:46,290 --> 00:03:47,130
All right.

72
00:03:47,130 --> 00:03:52,670
I found this in my car.

73
00:03:52,770 --> 00:03:54,660
Pretty simple pretty simple.

74
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:57,240
It's the same as saying I find this in my car.

75
00:03:57,300 --> 00:04:02,170
The only difference is that we've changed into the past tense.

76
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:04,720
We've changed the verb into the past tense.

77
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:06,970
Everything else is the same.

78
00:04:06,990 --> 00:04:08,340
Doesn't need to be changed.

79
00:04:08,370 --> 00:04:09,540
Pretty pretty simple.

80
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:14,070
OK let's just do let's just do one more really really quick example.

81
00:04:14,070 --> 00:04:15,990
Wait wait.

82
00:04:15,990 --> 00:04:16,280
All right.

83
00:04:16,290 --> 00:04:17,190
That's a regular one.

84
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:18,140
That's E.D..

85
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:26,250
So but this one pronunciation we don't say wait or something like that we say waited.

86
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:30,930
It's very clearly pronounced as ID because of the T sound.

87
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:39,510
If you don't know how to use the E.D. pronunciation then you need to watch one of my other courses about

88
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:43,440
pronunciation to to know how to say that correctly.

89
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:44,940
And other E.D. sounds.

90
00:04:44,970 --> 00:04:53,340
Anyway let's look at the example then I waited and a lot of people will pronounce this as waited waited.

91
00:04:53,340 --> 00:05:03,410
It's almost a d sound waited I waited I waited all morning for the call I waited all morning I waited

92
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:05,330
all morning for the call.

93
00:05:05,330 --> 00:05:06,050
Pretty simple.

94
00:05:06,070 --> 00:05:06,590
OK.

95
00:05:06,770 --> 00:05:08,470
Why is it simple past.

96
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:12,740
Why is it this one why is it waited instead of another one because it's finished.

97
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:14,200
It's a thing that happened.

98
00:05:14,330 --> 00:05:15,770
Now it's done.

99
00:05:15,770 --> 00:05:20,990
We don't have to worry about its relationship to other things that happened and so we just use this

100
00:05:20,990 --> 00:05:21,710
one.

101
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:23,600
It's pretty simple OK.

102
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:27,510
Now I hope you have a pretty clear idea about how to use the simple past.

103
00:05:27,530 --> 00:05:29,130
It's really just a warm up.

104
00:05:29,150 --> 00:05:33,800
Let's get into some of the more complicated stuff.

105
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:38,440
Some of the more difficult and juicy bits of past tense.

106
00:05:38,450 --> 00:05:42,050
This is where it hopefully gets a little bit more interesting.

107
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:43,630
So let's let's get started on that.
