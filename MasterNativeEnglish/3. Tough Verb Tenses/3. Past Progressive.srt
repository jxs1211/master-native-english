1
00:00:00,050 --> 00:00:04,410
OK so now we'll look at what's called the past progressive or the past continuous.

2
00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:11,670
And again don't worry about the names so much not so important but really this is all about how we describe

3
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:14,760
things that happened in the past.

4
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:23,280
And we want to focus on that being in the moment or actually experiencing that time because usually

5
00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:25,190
when we use this either.

6
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:30,450
Another thing was happening at the same time two things at the same time.

7
00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:36,720
Or one thing was happening and something stopped it.

8
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:38,540
That's how we usually use this.

9
00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:44,880
Something was happening and then another very important thing went and stopped that thing or interrupted

10
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:53,070
it and we say that thing that was happening as a way to say basically a little bit of context or a little

11
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:56,760
bit of background before we say this really important thing.

12
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:57,000
All right.

13
00:00:57,020 --> 00:00:58,920
So let's talk about the first one.

14
00:00:58,950 --> 00:01:02,550
First the one where there are two things going on.

15
00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:07,360
We use often was was or were.

16
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:12,640
And then when we use the verb we use i n g we use i n g after it.

17
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:18,040
So if you use was and were the verb after it will usually be i n g.

18
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:20,150
And two things are happening at the same time.

19
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:33,420
He was he was he was playing football and she was watching watching what were watching him play football

20
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:40,660
but he was playing football and she was watching if we use we then we would say we were right.

21
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:47,610
He was playing football and we were watching two things going on same time one action this person one

22
00:01:47,610 --> 00:01:50,690
action she or one action we.

23
00:01:50,770 --> 00:01:52,830
OK that one's pretty simple.

24
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:56,850
The other one actually is a little bit more common.

25
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:59,250
So let me race this and then we'll look at the other one.

26
00:01:59,250 --> 00:01:59,520
All right.

27
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:04,770
Now for this one we often use this one when we're telling stories because some important thing happened

28
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:10,050
in the story and we want to give a little bit of background information about the thing that was happening

29
00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:11,820
right before that important thing.

30
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:12,450
OK.

31
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:14,580
So we have an action.

32
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:16,520
We have an action that's going on.

33
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:19,150
And then do the thing stops it.

34
00:02:19,170 --> 00:02:22,440
We often say but when is probably the most common.

35
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:30,150
Sometimes we also use until and then when we say the second action that one should be just simple past.

36
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:36,760
So was I and G were i n g and then h until.

37
00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:40,100
When and then simple past.

38
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:41,240
Let me give you an example.

39
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:41,530
All right.

40
00:02:41,530 --> 00:02:49,520
Example example I was I was eating I was eating lunch when Hey.

41
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:50,800
When.

42
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:51,190
OK.

43
00:02:51,210 --> 00:02:54,390
So eat was eating lunch when.

44
00:02:54,390 --> 00:02:56,190
Now the important thing happens.

45
00:02:56,310 --> 00:03:05,040
I got simple pass I got a phone call or a phone call and then we can say what the phone call was about.

46
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:09,550
I got a phone call from my sister who told me that blah blah blah blah blah.

47
00:03:09,570 --> 00:03:13,310
Something important happened something terrible happened Something great happened.

48
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:14,160
Whatever.

49
00:03:14,350 --> 00:03:18,240
But we use this to give a little bit of background before the phone call.

50
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,710
This is really really common.

51
00:03:19,710 --> 00:03:25,620
So here's another one we were waiting for the call or the gift or the letter or whatever it doesn't

52
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:25,920
matter.

53
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:29,450
We were waiting for the call but it never came.

54
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:37,380
We were waiting for the call were waiting but it never came came as the simple past tense.

55
00:03:37,470 --> 00:03:37,970
OK.

56
00:03:38,070 --> 00:03:39,950
That was pretty simple as well.

57
00:03:39,990 --> 00:03:43,490
We want to focus on the fact that it didn't come OK.

58
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:44,970
It never came.

59
00:03:44,970 --> 00:03:50,520
But we want to say we were waiting to give us a feeling that this is an important thing that this didn't

60
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:51,270
happen.

61
00:03:51,270 --> 00:03:52,770
This is really making me angry.

62
00:03:52,770 --> 00:03:58,460
We waited 10 10 weeks for this letter to come and it never came right.

63
00:03:58,470 --> 00:04:01,510
So you can show your frustration by using this.

64
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:04,160
Were waiting was waiting OK.

65
00:04:04,230 --> 00:04:13,160
She was speaking about her passion for accounting.

66
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:24,690
It's a little boring right until someone sets an M someone in the audience stood up and said Stop

67
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:27,850
ok.

68
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:32,760
So put quotes around this to me OK so said is the simple past.

69
00:04:32,770 --> 00:04:34,030
That's the thing that happened.

70
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:40,070
But if someone just stood up and said Stop there would be no context no situation.

71
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:46,720
If we say she spoke and someone stood up and said Stop that's not really what was happening before it

72
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:52,120
doesn't give us a feeling of this action and then push something that completely stops it.

73
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:58,750
So we need to use was speaking here she was speaking until someone in the audience stood up and said

74
00:04:59,020 --> 00:05:07,090
Stop Now that's kind of a weird example but hopefully it gives you an idea for why we would use was

75
00:05:07,090 --> 00:05:10,990
or were plus I N G and then use the simple past.

76
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:16,750
And I want to make make sure I'm clear that I'm not trying to offend any accountants out there if you're

77
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:17,760
an accountant.

78
00:05:18,070 --> 00:05:23,050
I admire you because I think accounting is a little boring.

79
00:05:23,050 --> 00:05:28,300
And so if you're able to do something that's very hard I respect you.
