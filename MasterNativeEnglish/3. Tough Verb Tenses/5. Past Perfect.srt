1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:01,950
So we've talked about the simple past.

2
00:00:01,950 --> 00:00:05,310
We've talked about the past progressive or continuous.

3
00:00:05,310 --> 00:00:07,410
We've talked about present perfect.

4
00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:09,350
Now we need to talk about past perfect.

5
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:11,750
This one is a little bit difficult.

6
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:16,500
So we have to use a lot of examples to kind of get the feeling for it.

7
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:26,610
However we can make it a little easier by saying that it's grammatically similar to the present perfect

8
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:34,560
where we say have for example I have been the only change we make is saying had been had been going

9
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:44,640
instead of have been going OK or we can say I had finished I had finished doesn't have to be i n g so

10
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:52,680
that way it's similar to the present perfect tense the one we did before but when we use it is a little

11
00:00:52,680 --> 00:01:01,560
bit more complicated it can be used to express what I call a past of a past if you want to use it in

12
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:08,460
the same way as the present perfect where it goes up to some point it's like that but then that point

13
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:13,250
is not the present not now it's in the past and now is over here.

14
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:18,030
So that's a little bit complicated but I'll give you some examples in a minute.

15
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:25,650
We can also say just like we did with the present perfect tense we can also say that something happened

16
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:32,310
a certain number of times or something happened or didn't happen before.

17
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:36,720
Another thing that happened in the past and now is over here.

18
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:44,020
So this happened and this happened and then here's last Tuesday and then this is now.

19
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:44,370
All right.

20
00:01:44,370 --> 00:01:47,250
So it's two things happened before this happened.

21
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:51,330
Totally it's three things but two things happened before that.

22
00:01:51,330 --> 00:01:57,260
So let's look at some pretty simple examples with this past perfect tense.

23
00:01:57,330 --> 00:02:04,360
I had been going to the gym every day until I got my new job.

24
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:05,880
I had been.

25
00:02:05,970 --> 00:02:08,010
So that thing was going on.

26
00:02:08,010 --> 00:02:11,490
It's like saying I have been going to the gym every day.

27
00:02:11,490 --> 00:02:14,340
I have been would mean that it's going on now.

28
00:02:14,610 --> 00:02:23,970
But I got my new job maybe a month ago and so it stopped when I got my new job.

29
00:02:23,970 --> 00:02:26,700
So now I'm not going to the gym.

30
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:29,000
It stopped in the past.

31
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:32,550
I have been going to the gym up until now.

32
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:41,760
I had been going to the gym up until a past point I had been going to the gym every day until I got

33
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,080
my new job.

34
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:44,380
Now.

35
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:45,070
OK.

36
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:48,180
How long had you been waiting.

37
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:50,000
Before I arrived.

38
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:52,230
This should be at BGF Sorry.

39
00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:52,860
Sorry.

40
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:55,070
How long had you been waiting.

41
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:55,920
Before I arrived.

42
00:02:56,470 --> 00:02:56,710
OK.

43
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:59,620
So I arrived at 2 p.m..

44
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:02,730
Now it's 5:00 p.m. It's over here 5 p.m. now.

45
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,110
This is 2:00 p.m. OK.

46
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:07,380
And you are waiting for me right.

47
00:03:07,410 --> 00:03:08,560
I have been waiting.

48
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:14,060
If you arrive and I'm sitting here I'll say I've been waiting up until the present.

49
00:03:14,070 --> 00:03:16,340
Right now I've been waiting for an hour.

50
00:03:16,350 --> 00:03:21,220
Oh I'm sorry but this is in the past 2:00 p.m..

51
00:03:21,330 --> 00:03:23,630
How long had you been waiting.

52
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:26,720
Before I arrived.

53
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:33,590
How long had you been waiting before I arrived so you can think of it in a similar way to the other

54
00:03:33,590 --> 00:03:34,740
one we learned.

55
00:03:34,910 --> 00:03:38,980
But you just push the present back into the past.

56
00:03:39,740 --> 00:03:42,000
And now we have a a now here.

57
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:42,380
Right.

58
00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:45,920
But basically the idea is the same.

59
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:46,630
I hope that's clear.

60
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:49,220
But we'll go over a couple more examples anyway.

61
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:49,520
OK.

62
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:51,200
So a few more examples here.

63
00:03:51,260 --> 00:04:02,400
We had been friends we had been friends for many years until we started at different high schools.

64
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:04,430
So that means now are we friends.

65
00:04:04,450 --> 00:04:07,790
No no we're not probably not friends anymore.

66
00:04:07,810 --> 00:04:14,920
We had been friends we had been best friends until we started at different high schools.

67
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:21,770
We started at different high schools maybe 15 years ago 15 years ago we started at different high schools.

68
00:04:21,790 --> 00:04:25,600
We had been very very good friends up until then.

69
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:26,170
OK.

70
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:30,480
Can we say we were very good friends until high school.

71
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:31,420
Past tense.

72
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:31,990
Yeah yeah.

73
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:34,410
You can you can say that in this case.

74
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:39,790
But sometimes it makes it more clear to use this past perfect tense.

75
00:04:39,850 --> 00:04:47,170
I had seen the movie once already but went again and then we could say maybe last night because why.

76
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:49,990
Because I really liked it well I really like it.

77
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:52,190
You still like it so you can use that too.

78
00:04:52,210 --> 00:04:56,170
So on Tuesday I saw the movie the first time.

79
00:04:56,170 --> 00:04:56,520
Wow.

80
00:04:56,530 --> 00:04:57,660
Such a good movie.

81
00:04:57,770 --> 00:04:58,140
Right.

82
00:04:58,150 --> 00:05:03,400
And then last night I went another time because I enjoyed it.

83
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:06,640
Now it's maybe three days later.

84
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:08,850
So I have seen the movie.

85
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:09,730
How many times.

86
00:05:09,730 --> 00:05:10,960
Totally.

87
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:14,310
I have seen it twice.

88
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:17,590
I have seen it twice.

89
00:05:17,590 --> 00:05:23,910
But when I want to talk about seeing it the last time I saw it.

90
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:30,850
All right three days ago I saw it most recently three days ago and then talk about how many times before

91
00:05:30,850 --> 00:05:42,580
that past thing I saw it one time then I would say I had seen it once already but went again last night

92
00:05:42,670 --> 00:05:46,810
for three days ago in my other example not trying to confuse you there.

93
00:05:46,810 --> 00:05:47,800
How about this.

94
00:05:47,830 --> 00:05:49,910
I went to Canada.

95
00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:52,450
I went to Canada on Monday.

96
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:59,540
I had already been there three times OK.

97
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:03,450
So how many times have I been to Canada four.

98
00:06:03,710 --> 00:06:08,990
I had already been there three times before I went there on Monday.

99
00:06:08,990 --> 00:06:09,920
Now I'm not there.

100
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:12,480
Now I'm back where I live right.

101
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:21,210
So we basically are talking about past things that happened before another past thing.

102
00:06:21,290 --> 00:06:23,000
I went to Canada on Monday.

103
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,460
I went to Canada on Monday.

104
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:28,370
I had been there three times before.

105
00:06:28,370 --> 00:06:30,650
OK let's try another example.

106
00:06:30,650 --> 00:06:35,820
I had asked her to wait for me but when I came outside she was gone.

107
00:06:36,050 --> 00:06:38,700
So we could just say I came outside and she was gone.

108
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:41,720
That's a simple past thing that happened right.

109
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:42,600
Simple past.

110
00:06:42,650 --> 00:06:44,750
I came outside and she was gone.

111
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:52,040
But if I want to give that more detail and I want to express more about the whole situation I can talk

112
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:56,240
about what I did before I came outside and saw that she was gone.

113
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:57,590
Well what did I do before that.

114
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:01,260
I asked her to wait for me outside.

115
00:07:01,670 --> 00:07:06,980
So I want to express a past thing that happened before another past thing.

116
00:07:06,980 --> 00:07:11,670
That's when it's really really useful to use past perfect tense.

117
00:07:11,690 --> 00:07:18,670
I had asked her to wait for me but when I got outside or when I came outside she was gone.

118
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:24,770
Now we have a really clear picture of the whole thing that happened in many cases using this style of

119
00:07:24,770 --> 00:07:28,190
grammar using this tense makes it really clear.

120
00:07:28,190 --> 00:07:30,950
The difficulty is how do you do it right.

121
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:36,650
Getting enough practice is really important so you can get the feel for how to use this more difficult

122
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:40,710
type of grammar this more difficult tense.

123
00:07:40,910 --> 00:07:42,040
So practice it.

124
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:43,920
I'll provide the examples.

125
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:46,190
Make sure you review those really carefully.

126
00:07:46,310 --> 00:07:51,980
Lots of examples are a great way to get the feeling for something but it's also very important to do

127
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:54,880
lots of practice because then it can become a habit.

128
00:07:54,890 --> 00:07:58,720
And when you want to express yourself it's right there.

129
00:07:58,760 --> 00:07:59,030
All right.

130
00:07:59,050 --> 00:08:05,180
So an assignment to practice this make at least two sentences with each tense each.

131
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:14,090
Each one we learned the simple past the past progressive right was going the present perfect and the

132
00:08:14,090 --> 00:08:15,820
past perfect practice.

133
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:19,240
All of the different types make two sentences or more.

134
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:22,810
Don't worry too much about remembering the names right.

135
00:08:22,850 --> 00:08:27,500
Focus on the examples that I gave you in this lesson.

136
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:32,570
And then just make sure you feel really comfortable using each one you need to get comfortable with

137
00:08:32,570 --> 00:08:32,890
it.

138
00:08:32,930 --> 00:08:38,300
If you do you'll be able to express things in time wherever you are especially in the past which is

139
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:39,420
the most difficult.

140
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:45,800
You'll be able to do those things really easily and that will give you a lot of power because when you

141
00:08:45,830 --> 00:08:49,660
speak people will go Oh well I understand exactly what you're saying.

142
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:52,520
You have command over time.

143
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:54,240
Practice is really important.

144
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:57,050
And so I hope you practice a lot.

145
00:08:57,110 --> 00:09:03,950
And if it's boring just remember you know it's gonna get more interesting it's going to get more fun.

146
00:09:03,950 --> 00:09:04,210
All right.
