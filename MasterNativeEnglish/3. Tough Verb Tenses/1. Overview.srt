1
00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:09,460
So in the last lesson we talked about how to describe things clearly right.

2
00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:16,950
In this lesson we're going to also focus on something that's very very important to know how to do to

3
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:21,110
know how to use if you want to be able to speak English.

4
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:28,620
Well if you feel very very comfortable with different verb tenses which is what we're going to talk

5
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:32,600
about in this lesson you can skip this one and go to the next.

6
00:00:32,670 --> 00:00:38,700
But if you don't feel totally confident then you really need to watch this lesson very carefully.

7
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:45,060
We do this one and the last lesson because it's so important to have these things first before we go

8
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:53,220
on to some of the more fun stuff like inviting people to do things or hanging out at a coffee shop or

9
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:54,300
ordering stuff.

10
00:00:54,390 --> 00:01:00,510
That's a lot more maybe fun and interesting but we really need to make sure we have the what I would

11
00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:02,820
call fundamentals.

12
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:06,620
Oh I don't even have room fundamentals down.

13
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:09,120
This should be done.

14
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:10,350
Fundamentals down.

15
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:13,290
Before we get into that other stuff.

16
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:16,890
So a tense what is that what is what is a verb tense.

17
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:23,730
Well in English when you're saying things that happen you're talking about what happened and you need

18
00:01:23,730 --> 00:01:26,520
to say when it happened yesterday tomorrow today.

19
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:35,100
Now we use different verb tenses to basically say when the action happen we have to change verbs.

20
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:36,370
I'm sure you know this.

21
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:43,090
We have to change verbs according to when things happen so that they agree with each other.

22
00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:43,340
Right.

23
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:45,310
And this can be a little confusing.

24
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:47,940
Sometimes it's simple sometimes it's not.

25
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:55,110
We're going to go through these and I'm going to give you examples examples are the best way to learn

26
00:01:55,110 --> 00:01:59,080
how to use verb tenses because knowing these names.

27
00:01:59,110 --> 00:02:03,570
Simple right past simple tense progressive tense.

28
00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:06,380
Knowing these names is not that important.

29
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:13,170
If you don't learn the names of grammar things that's fine because you're not an English teacher right.

30
00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:18,750
I need to know the names of different kinds of grammar but nobody else does.

31
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:24,480
So don't worry about that so much focus on the examples and try to get the feeling for them.

32
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:30,720
And then I'll give you some practice to do so that you can actually understand hopefully deeply how

33
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:37,470
to use different verb tenses and it can become I hope a habit for you so that when you're speaking you

34
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:39,830
don't have to think about it.

35
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:40,210
OK.

36
00:02:40,230 --> 00:02:43,650
That is the goal that you can use these naturally.

37
00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:44,530
You don't need to think.

38
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:45,530
So let's get started.
