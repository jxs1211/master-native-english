1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:02,900
OK so we've talked about the.

2
00:00:03,460 --> 00:00:05,400
That's a dog barking outside.

3
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:10,820
We've talked about the past progressive tense where something is going on.

4
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:12,570
And we talked about the simple past.

5
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:14,480
Pretty simple pretty easy.

6
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:17,220
Now it starts to get a little bit more complicated.

7
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:20,300
We're going to talk about present perfect OK.

8
00:00:20,570 --> 00:00:25,710
I'm going to try to draw it out so you can get a picture of why we would use this.

9
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:28,680
And then we'll of course look at some examples.

10
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:33,210
This is a bit tough because of when we use it.

11
00:00:33,330 --> 00:00:39,900
And it's also a little bit tough because how you make it is more than just changing one word.

12
00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:46,620
Usually the present perfect focuses on something that we say now about the past as well.

13
00:00:46,650 --> 00:00:48,920
It includes the past and the present.

14
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:56,940
The first one that we use is to express something that we do now or is still going on now but which

15
00:00:56,940 --> 00:00:58,520
began before.

16
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:05,650
And we're sort of combining the fact that it began before and has continued up to the present moment.

17
00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:18,650
So all the way up until now to do that we use have or has and then we use the what's called the past

18
00:01:18,650 --> 00:01:23,480
participle the past participle is a special verb.

19
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:24,120
OK.

20
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:28,640
It's a special verb because it's sometimes different than the simple past.

21
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:38,060
For example you know go and you know went right went is the simple past But gone is the past participle

22
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:46,190
Gone is the past participle so have gone would be the correct way to use it OK have gone and there are

23
00:01:46,190 --> 00:01:48,490
lots of different past participles.

24
00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:55,820
The difficult thing is that sometimes they're different from the simple past and sometimes they're the

25
00:01:55,820 --> 00:01:56,550
same.

26
00:01:56,570 --> 00:02:04,050
For example we talked about the word walk before have walked is also the past participle WRAL K D.

27
00:02:04,430 --> 00:02:12,540
I walked I have walked it's the same but for this one go went and gone it's different.

28
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:18,470
And you just have to get a feeling for it or if you really want to get serious you can look up a long

29
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:23,240
list of verbs and study what the past participles are.

30
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:29,540
I would recommend just reading and watching movies and talking to people to get a feeling for which

31
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:35,840
ones they are and I think you probably know many of them now you would have also seen another form where

32
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:41,040
you have have has right.

33
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:41,650
I have.

34
00:02:41,650 --> 00:02:42,670
She has.

35
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:43,870
It has.

36
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:44,890
They have.

37
00:02:44,890 --> 00:02:49,700
Then you have the past participle bin b e n.

38
00:02:49,790 --> 00:02:50,410
Yes.

39
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:51,360
Yes bin.

40
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:52,370
It's got to be bin.

41
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:52,760
OK.

42
00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:59,520
B was or were and the past participle is been I have been.

43
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:11,620
She has been it has been they have been and then a verb like this plus i n g OK for example she have

44
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:23,290
or has has been living i n g living she has been eating she has been going she has been talking whatever

45
00:03:23,730 --> 00:03:26,280
she's been talking for forty five minutes

46
00:03:29,330 --> 00:03:30,280
when will she finish.

47
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:38,710
That means she's still talking now he's been walking for a week he's been walking for a week that means

48
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:48,310
he's doing it still and it started a week ago this is how we usually use this kind of grammar this kind

49
00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:49,420
of tense.

50
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:52,830
OK something that started before and continues now.

51
00:03:52,990 --> 00:03:58,600
So we'll look at some examples of how we do that and then we'll talk about this next kind which is a

52
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:01,900
little bit more it's a little bit more complicated.

53
00:04:01,930 --> 00:04:02,130
OK.

54
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:11,230
So this type I I have been playing football for three years.

55
00:04:11,230 --> 00:04:11,500
OK.

56
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:14,060
Does that mean that I'm playing football at this moment.

57
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:14,350
No.

58
00:04:14,350 --> 00:04:15,980
That means in my life.

59
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:16,300
Right.

60
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:22,200
I started three years ago and I still play maybe I only play once a week or once a month.

61
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:25,740
But the point is it's still going on now for me.

62
00:04:26,030 --> 00:04:26,370
OK.

63
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:30,450
I have been playing football for three years continuing.

64
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:31,840
Let's try another one.

65
00:04:31,930 --> 00:04:32,700
I've.

66
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:35,610
We can also say I've I've means I have.

67
00:04:35,630 --> 00:04:36,290
Right.

68
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:43,620
I've been working overtime a lot recently now for this one.

69
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:46,600
We don't say how much time has passed and that's OK.

70
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:53,020
The point is that it did begin before some point maybe a week or two weeks or three weeks we don't know

71
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:56,350
exactly but it's still going on now.

72
00:04:56,380 --> 00:04:58,020
That's the important point.

73
00:04:58,030 --> 00:04:58,300
OK.

74
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:01,020
So something started before continuing now.

75
00:05:01,030 --> 00:05:09,070
I have been working overtime a lot recently working overtime by the way means that you go over 40 hours

76
00:05:09,190 --> 00:05:10,920
in a workweek usually.

77
00:05:10,990 --> 00:05:14,940
So usually supposed to work eight hours a day maybe you work 10 hours every day.

78
00:05:14,950 --> 00:05:16,080
It's called overtime.

79
00:05:16,090 --> 00:05:19,950
It's called overtime and working overtime a lot recently.

80
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:22,050
So this one is kind of simple right.

81
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:29,080
Now the other way that we use this kind of tense is to talk about something that's about the past.

82
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:35,710
It's true about the past but we're saying that it's it's true now about the past that that might be

83
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:37,750
a little bit confusing right.

84
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:42,600
But if I give you a couple of examples I think you get the idea a little bit better.

85
00:05:42,610 --> 00:05:46,060
So this one we usually don't say have been blah blah blah.

86
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:48,960
We just say I have done that.

87
00:05:48,970 --> 00:05:58,930
We just use the have and then past participle for example I have visited Canada three times totally

88
00:05:58,930 --> 00:05:59,800
in my life.

89
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:03,220
Now why wouldn't I just say I went to Canada three times.

90
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:09,680
What's the difference between I have been to Canada three times and I went to Canada three times.

91
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:15,490
When we're talking about how many times we've done something totally right or within a certain time

92
00:06:15,490 --> 00:06:19,300
period we could say I have been to Canada I have visited Canada.

93
00:06:19,510 --> 00:06:27,130
Totally right or within one year or whatever three times and we don't care about when each time happened.

94
00:06:27,130 --> 00:06:28,200
So then we use this one.

95
00:06:28,210 --> 00:06:29,470
That's how we use it.

96
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:31,510
That's true now about the past.

97
00:06:31,510 --> 00:06:35,610
If I want to say when I went then I'll use the simple past.

98
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:43,690
I've been to Canada three times I went last June and I went twice the year before.

99
00:06:43,690 --> 00:06:50,350
So we often use the simple past to talk about the specific times and or when it happened and we use

100
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:55,750
this one to just say totally this many times don't worry about the details we're not going to focus

101
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:56,740
on the details.

102
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:00,070
We're just talking about right now at this point in my life.

103
00:07:00,190 --> 00:07:04,240
How many times has this thing happened or has it happened or not.

104
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:07,210
Sometimes when we want to say did it happen or not.

105
00:07:07,210 --> 00:07:17,110
We used the same way we can say for example I have seen you before seen as the past participle of Si

106
00:07:17,530 --> 00:07:19,550
I have seen you before.

107
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:20,430
It's true.

108
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:21,830
I've seen you before.

109
00:07:21,970 --> 00:07:26,440
You don't you say I saw you before because then we might focus on the details.

110
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:30,220
I saw you before last Tuesday I saw you last week.

111
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:31,170
The details.

112
00:07:31,190 --> 00:07:31,510
Right.

113
00:07:31,870 --> 00:07:36,220
But if we say I have seen you before we don't care about when it happened.

114
00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:37,520
It's just true.

115
00:07:37,570 --> 00:07:37,870
Right.

116
00:07:37,870 --> 00:07:42,780
So we use this one often when we're talking about just the reality the truth.

117
00:07:42,850 --> 00:07:43,360
Right.

118
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:45,060
If we wanted to say the opposite.

119
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:47,870
I have never seen you before is also correct.

120
00:07:47,890 --> 00:07:50,200
We can add the word never here.

121
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:51,820
I've never seen you before.

122
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:57,870
It is not true that I have seen you but sometimes it really is exactly the same as the simple past tense.

123
00:07:57,880 --> 00:08:00,690
And you can choose either one it doesn't really matter.

124
00:08:00,850 --> 00:08:05,130
You can say I already eight it happen.

125
00:08:05,140 --> 00:08:05,630
You're done.

126
00:08:05,630 --> 00:08:06,050
OK.

127
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:09,220
I have already.

128
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:10,450
What should I put here.

129
00:08:10,450 --> 00:08:14,270
What's the past participle for eight eaten.

130
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:16,690
I have already eaten I already ate.

131
00:08:16,730 --> 00:08:17,840
Is it different.

132
00:08:18,170 --> 00:08:18,680
Not really.

133
00:08:18,710 --> 00:08:26,280
So sometimes they're kind of the same and you can choose either one but in many cases many times they

134
00:08:26,390 --> 00:08:27,740
are not the same.

135
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:33,290
And you need to be careful if you want to talk about details maybe use simple past if you want to talk

136
00:08:33,290 --> 00:08:37,610
about totally how many times or totally did it happen or not.

137
00:08:37,610 --> 00:08:42,530
Is it true then maybe use the present perfect tense.
