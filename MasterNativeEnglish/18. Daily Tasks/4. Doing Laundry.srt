1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:06,060
So let's actually go through a real example of how someone might describe doing laundry.

2
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:10,640
One very very common household chore I'm sure we've all done laundry at some point.

3
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:11,740
We have to be clear.

4
00:00:11,850 --> 00:00:16,600
But again we're going to try to make it a little bit more interesting and not totally boring.

5
00:00:16,780 --> 00:00:17,230
OK.

6
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:25,080
My clothes are always strewn around my room remember strewn means strewn means all over on the floor

7
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:25,890
on the chair.

8
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:26,450
OK.

9
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:33,180
So when I need to do laundry I have to get them all in a pile and then sort them into two smaller piles

10
00:00:33,330 --> 00:00:36,450
colours and whites colors and whites.

11
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:39,150
These are the two piles that I make.

12
00:00:39,150 --> 00:00:39,480
OK.

13
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:40,950
I'm a bit picky like that.

14
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:41,580
What does that mean.

15
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:42,180
Picky.

16
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:45,420
I don't like to just get everything all together and throw it in.

17
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:50,490
I'm a little bit picky and that means I like to have this this way and this this way I like to have

18
00:00:50,490 --> 00:00:51,700
this thing in this pile.

19
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:57,520
The whites over here the colors over here maybe even blue there and yellow there maybe.

20
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:58,380
Probably not.

21
00:00:58,650 --> 00:01:01,590
But this is a way to make it a little more interesting.

22
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:05,520
I'm adding something about myself I'm a bit picky like that.

23
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:11,980
I have to separate laundry baskets and I always wash colors separately.

24
00:01:12,010 --> 00:01:15,780
OK so not everybody has two laundry baskets.

25
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:22,290
This person has two laundry baskets which kind of shows how picky he or she is.

26
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:23,580
OK let's go on.

27
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:30,900
My family's washing machine is in the bathroom and it has a dial with settings for different temperatures

28
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:32,900
times and load sizes.

29
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:33,110
OK.

30
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:37,380
So if there's another machine it's probably the dryer.

31
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:39,930
That's the one that's usually the same size.

32
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:43,110
They often come in a set in America.

33
00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:49,380
They come in a set usually and after you take things out of the washer or washing machine you put them

34
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:52,170
in the dryer.

35
00:01:52,230 --> 00:01:56,460
It's not as common to hang clothes up although some people do.

36
00:01:56,520 --> 00:02:03,240
OK my family's washing machine is in the bathroom and it has a dial with settings for different temperatures.

37
00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:03,550
OK.

38
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:07,050
Dial is a circle.

39
00:02:07,050 --> 00:02:14,070
And there's another circle in the middle that maybe it's called a knob a knob and then it has different

40
00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:15,550
things around the outside.

41
00:02:15,570 --> 00:02:26,290
And you can turn this knob and get the right settings the settings the settings are the things you change

42
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:33,130
usually for something that has electronics in it an electronic device for example your cell phone you

43
00:02:33,130 --> 00:02:40,360
have a settings menu and you can change different things on your phone or about your phone in settings

44
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:47,050
so a dial with settings for different temperatures times and load sizes.

45
00:02:47,050 --> 00:02:52,820
Temperatures would probably be cold water warm water and hot water.

46
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:58,890
By the way sometimes people use Luke which mine is my name lukewarm anyway.

47
00:02:59,290 --> 00:03:04,730
Then we have then we have temperatures times which would be maybe 30 minutes.

48
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:08,830
So I guess you could say one group of clothes is called a load.

49
00:03:08,830 --> 00:03:21,850
We use the word load one load of laundry a load of laundry and load sizes would probably be no small

50
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:29,470
and maybe medium large and what that probably means but it usually means is how much water is going

51
00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:33,070
to be added to it if you only have a few things and you put that in there.

52
00:03:33,070 --> 00:03:34,650
It's a small load size.

53
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:40,600
Maybe the machine only needs to use a little water if you have a huge load of laundry put that in it

54
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:41,880
needs to add more water.

55
00:03:41,890 --> 00:03:44,050
So you would choose something like that.

56
00:03:44,050 --> 00:03:50,170
A large load or sometimes a heavy heavy load sometimes it depends on the machine.

57
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,360
Temperatures times in load sizes.

58
00:03:52,390 --> 00:03:58,390
I do the colors first and then do whites in the second load in the second load.

59
00:03:58,390 --> 00:04:00,660
OK so first colors and then whites.

60
00:04:00,670 --> 00:04:05,950
These are the two groups of clothes although we don't usually use groups here.

61
00:04:05,950 --> 00:04:11,590
I actually hand wash a lot of my linens or anything delicate.

62
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:15,640
OK so linens are usually very light clothes.

63
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:17,170
That means they're not very heavy.

64
00:04:17,170 --> 00:04:23,650
And if you put them in with other other clothes they might be broken or damaged or anything delicate.

65
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:29,470
So for example underwear maybe underwear would be considered delicate and we can sometimes call those

66
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:30,120
delicate.

67
00:04:30,130 --> 00:04:37,900
My mom yells at me if I put delicate in the machine my mom yells at me if I put delegates in the machine.

68
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:43,120
So if I put maybe underwear in the machine she yells at me again I'm trying to make the story a little

69
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:43,940
more interesting.

70
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:49,670
I'm describing a process but I'm trying to add a little bit of interesting hopefully personal detail.

71
00:04:49,670 --> 00:04:49,890
OK.

72
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:55,550
Last piece of this laundry story I add detergent according to the measurement line.

73
00:04:55,750 --> 00:05:02,040
So if there is a cup that we use to measure remember that detergent is the soap that we use.

74
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:06,880
There's a line here maybe for small and in line here for a heavier load.

75
00:05:07,090 --> 00:05:11,590
So maybe I will fill up the cup to the measurement line.

76
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:13,100
OK.

77
00:05:13,450 --> 00:05:17,850
I add detergent according to the measurement line on the cap of the bottle.

78
00:05:17,890 --> 00:05:18,160
OK.

79
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:26,880
So this little cup actually goes on to the detergent the detergent bottle.

80
00:05:27,050 --> 00:05:30,140
It's used as the measuring cup or measuring cap.

81
00:05:30,140 --> 00:05:36,110
Then set the machine for colors and turn the dial remember the dial to thirty five minutes after the

82
00:05:36,110 --> 00:05:38,940
final spin cycle finishes.

83
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:44,290
So the spin cycle is the last thing that happens when you put your laundry in.

84
00:05:44,450 --> 00:05:45,940
It fills up with water.

85
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:47,630
It gets all soapy.

86
00:05:47,630 --> 00:05:54,140
There are lots of we can say suds mixing around with your clothes and then it goes back and forth Juju.

87
00:05:54,230 --> 00:05:57,410
And it goes through many cycles at the very end.

88
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:01,640
You want to rinse out your clothes right.

89
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:07,360
You want to get them rinsed so there's no soap in them and you want to try to get them as dry as possible.

90
00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:15,760
So usually the machine will spin them very quickly to try to get all that water out and get all maybe

91
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:16,660
the soap out.

92
00:06:16,670 --> 00:06:22,560
If there's any there this is usually called the spin cycle spin cycle spin cycle.

93
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:24,950
After the final spin cycle finishes.

94
00:06:24,950 --> 00:06:31,190
I take everything out and air dry my clothes on a clothesline hanger drying rack.

95
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:38,330
All of these are ok clothesline hanger drying rack in the summer it takes forever for things to dry.

96
00:06:38,330 --> 00:06:43,600
So again I'm trying to add something interesting not just specific details I'm trying to fit it all

97
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:46,160
together in to something continuous.

98
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:48,440
Give all of the key words I need to give.

99
00:06:48,470 --> 00:06:54,360
Make sure the process is clear but also add a little bit of interesting detail.

100
00:06:54,470 --> 00:06:57,560
There's no need to say in the summer it takes forever to dry.

101
00:06:57,590 --> 00:07:02,780
But I add it just to make it a little bit more interesting and you can do that when you're describing

102
00:07:02,810 --> 00:07:07,580
instructions or any kind of process that you may need to describe.
