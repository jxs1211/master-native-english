1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:00,610
OK.

2
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:07,140
Now let's go through our real example of Aaron's we should be very comfortable with how to describe

3
00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:11,640
household chores and the words related to doing laundry.

4
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:17,110
We should be pretty comfortable with some of the phrases that we use to describe errands.

5
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:22,570
But let's actually look at how we can put them into practice with a real example.

6
00:00:22,570 --> 00:00:22,990
OK.

7
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:26,400
Yesterday I had to run to yo Mart.

8
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:27,750
I just made up that name.

9
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:32,040
I don't think there's a real yo mark to pick up a few things we need.

10
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:34,770
I bought vegetables and eggs for a dish.

11
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:41,010
I'm planning to cook tonight dishes one sort of thing I want to cook a dish I'm planning to cook tonight.

12
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:46,950
I also grabbed some milk and eggs because we were running low on both.

13
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:49,740
We're running low on both milk and eggs.

14
00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:52,370
My wife asked me to get some chocolate.

15
00:00:52,400 --> 00:01:00,450
So I bought her a few Dove chocolate bars and I also got several big cartons of almond milk for the

16
00:01:00,450 --> 00:01:01,330
week.

17
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:07,950
That means we probably drink several cartons of almond milk in one week in one week.

18
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:09,590
Maybe it's Monday OK.

19
00:01:09,690 --> 00:01:16,560
A carton is something usually made of cardboard or paper and it has a liquid inside orange juice milk

20
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:25,320
on the way home I stopped by the U.P.S. store stopped by the U.P.S. store to drop off a package I need

21
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:34,680
to send to my friend in Colorado so to drop something off is to go to a place to stop by a place usually

22
00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:41,280
for a short time maybe only a couple of minutes and leave something there to drop off a package at the

23
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:47,850
U.P.S. store I'll be there tomorrow I'll drop it off I can only stay for a minute and then I need to

24
00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:48,300
go.

25
00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:49,940
OK sure sure.

26
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:51,510
Drop it off.

27
00:01:51,510 --> 00:01:53,190
Could you drop it off later.

28
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:53,480
Yeah.

29
00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:54,150
No problem.

30
00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:58,340
So it's usually something that happens quickly and it's the opposite of pickup.

31
00:01:58,350 --> 00:02:03,240
We can use it also when we're talking about the train station situation.

32
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:06,840
I need to go to the train station to drop off my friend.

33
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:11,610
I have to drop off my kids at school drop off my kids at school.

34
00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:11,890
OK.

35
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:15,730
So I stopped by the U.P.S. store to drop off a package.

36
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:21,420
I need to send to my friend in Colorado my friend in Colorado.

37
00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:25,610
So we've used most of the phrases that we learned just before this.

38
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:27,720
Again they're very very common.

39
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:32,390
I hope that you can pay attention to how they're used and try using them yourself.

40
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,580
Next time you describe your routine.

41
00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:35,080
OK.

42
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:43,470
So to practice this try using the phrases that we learned to describe Aaron's to describe or explain

43
00:02:43,470 --> 00:02:49,320
the errands that you need to run today or tomorrow or sometime maybe this week.

44
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:53,480
Be very detailed if you want to explain it to a friend.

45
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:55,140
Record yourself.

46
00:02:55,140 --> 00:03:01,230
Record yourself doing it and speaking naturally trying to use these phrases and then listen to the recording

47
00:03:01,230 --> 00:03:07,140
again so that you can catch small mistakes and work on improve your speaking habits.

48
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:08,600
Recording is a great way.

49
00:03:08,610 --> 00:03:15,660
As I've said several times before to help yourself get in the habit of catching small mistakes and fixing

50
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:16,350
those things.

51
00:03:16,350 --> 00:03:20,340
It's a great way to improve your awareness awareness.

52
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:20,970
All right.

53
00:03:20,970 --> 00:03:21,750
Good luck.

54
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:22,920
See you in the next lesson.
