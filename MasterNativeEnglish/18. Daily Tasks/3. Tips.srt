00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:06,410
Before we get into some specific examples of housework a couple of tips to keep in mind.

2
00:00:06,470 --> 00:00:12,600
And this is something that I always have to remind myself as well when I'm describing a process maybe

3
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:16,030
I'm giving instructions to someone for how to do something.

4
00:00:16,090 --> 00:00:22,970
Maybe over the phone or I'm explaining the kind of things I regularly have to do kind of like a routine.

5
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:30,360
I always remember to tell a story so that doesn't mean I need to add a bunch of fake stuff but what

6
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:34,800
it means is I want to connect it together and make it personal.

7
00:00:34,830 --> 00:00:39,320
If I just say and then do this and then do this and then do this and then do this it's very dry.

8
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:47,210
I do try to think about using different types of sentences to keep the syntax interesting.

9
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:53,220
I also think about making sure to sometimes maybe add a little bit of emotion.

10
00:00:53,250 --> 00:01:00,390
Sometimes I will add a description of something maybe I'm doing in a little bit more detail but I try

11
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:03,640
to make it feel as much like I can like a simple story.

12
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:10,350
And when I think about it in this way it helps me I think explain what I want to explain clearly so

13
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:16,450
that the other person the person listening to me gets it immediately and doesn't miss out on the details.

14
00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:18,120
If it's kind of interesting.

15
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:23,990
If it's kind of interesting then people will probably like to listen to what you have to say.

16
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:31,380
So make it personal make it a story number to use the present tense just like when we're giving a routine

17
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:35,050
we're talking about activities that usually happen.

18
00:01:35,190 --> 00:01:39,530
So use the present tense because that makes it a lot easier.

19
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:45,630
You can focus on your sentence structure you can focus on using the right words you can focus on maybe

20
00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:50,850
making it a little bit interesting what you're describing what you have to do regularly because you're

21
00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:56,510
not thinking about do I need to make that in the past I don't know that makes it a lot easier.

22
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:59,130
So just use the present tense.

23
00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:00,430
Just use the present tense.

24
00:02:00,430 --> 00:02:02,510
OK those are two things I want you to remember.

25
00:02:02,550 --> 00:02:07,480
Now let's look at an example of chores specifically laundry.
