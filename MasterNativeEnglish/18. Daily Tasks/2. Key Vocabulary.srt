1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:04,770
So First some basic vocabulary things that we'll need to know for this.

2
00:00:04,770 --> 00:00:05,940
Lesson number one.

3
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:11,280
Chores chores are the things we usually do around the house could be in the House could be outside of

4
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:11,910
the house.

5
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:15,110
This might include mowing the lawn.

6
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:17,340
It might include dusting.

7
00:00:17,370 --> 00:00:24,270
It might include taking out the garbage we say garbage in America instead of rubbish which is what people

8
00:00:24,270 --> 00:00:27,750
in the UK will say and many other parts of the world.

9
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:31,480
So these kinds of things around the house we call chores.

10
00:00:31,530 --> 00:00:37,940
When I was a little boy every Sunday I had to dust the house that was my job.

11
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:44,310
I had to dust the house I had to go around with a rag and some special cleaner and clean all the surfaces

12
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:48,240
in the House to make sure everything looked shiny and nice and new.

13
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:56,970
That was my Sunday chore and I had other chores as well like feeding my cat and taking out the cat litter

14
00:00:57,330 --> 00:00:59,810
sometimes taking out the garbage.

15
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:00,590
This kind of thing.

16
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:03,960
Its chores errands then are a little different.

17
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:04,800
What's an Aaron.

18
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:10,650
Well Aaron is a little bit more difficult to explain but it's kind of similar to chores.

19
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:12,590
It's something we have to do.

20
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:13,830
It's something we have to do.

21
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:16,550
Usually it's not something we do for fun.

22
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:18,180
We don't dust the house for fun.

23
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:19,410
We go out to do it.

24
00:01:19,410 --> 00:01:21,470
That means we don't stay home.

25
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:27,540
It's kind of like a chore but outside and we're usually doing it pretty quickly pretty quickly.

26
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:30,120
It's not something that takes two or three hours.

27
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:35,970
The best way to really get a feel for this would be some very quick examples and what errands are not

28
00:01:36,130 --> 00:01:36,690
OK.

29
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:40,540
Well going to the dentist is something we have to do.

30
00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:42,650
But that might take an hour or two hours.

31
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:44,460
Is that a an errand.

32
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:44,950
No.

33
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,040
Usually going to the dentist is not an errand not an errand.

34
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:54,780
What about going shopping you might need to buy something I don't know what I need to buy but I need

35
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:59,220
to buy something maybe a jacket I go to a shop and look around.

36
00:01:59,220 --> 00:01:59,760
No.

37
00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:06,690
Usually when we run an errand and we often put run in front of an errand we could also say do an errand.

38
00:02:06,690 --> 00:02:10,410
We have it in our mind what we're going to do before we leave home.

39
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:15,480
So it's in mind I'm going to go to the supermarket to buy some tomatoes.

40
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:19,920
So we go out we go to the supermarket we buy some tomatoes and we come back.

41
00:02:19,950 --> 00:02:25,200
If we just say oh I might go hang out at the shopping center and maybe I'll buy some thing I need.

42
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,030
Probably not an errand.

43
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:30,900
What about staying at home and paying your phone bill something you need to do.

44
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:35,020
Well no because that is not going out.

45
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:37,230
You have to go out to run an errand.

46
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:42,000
OK how about having a quick lunch with maybe a colleague.

47
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,210
I have to meet them.

48
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:44,470
Have to have a quick lunch.

49
00:02:44,490 --> 00:02:45,740
Only 30 minutes.

50
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:48,270
No because it's it's a social thing.

51
00:02:48,330 --> 00:02:55,740
It's still a social thing and social things are not usually considered errands so things like maybe

52
00:02:55,800 --> 00:03:04,830
dropping off books get something repaired buy maybe food like groceries and maybe make an appointment

53
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:07,230
at the at the dentist's office.

54
00:03:07,350 --> 00:03:12,270
Make an appointment go to the dentist and you say I'd like to make an appointment.

55
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:15,700
That kind of thing can be considered an errand.

56
00:03:15,790 --> 00:03:18,020
OK we'll talk about that more later in the class.

57
00:03:18,090 --> 00:03:25,140
Housework is often the same as chores housework is only in the home usually chores can be a little bit

58
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:31,800
more general strewn is when things are all over the place and we often use strewn when we're talking

59
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:39,540
about clothes we have clothes strewn around the house they're all over the house they're all messed

60
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:46,680
up and we need to probably clean them up so we use strewn to describe this sort of messy or chaotic

61
00:03:47,010 --> 00:03:48,810
chaotic feeling detergent.

62
00:03:48,810 --> 00:03:56,940
Now we're gonna talk a little about laundry detergent is the main soap that we use for usually laundry

63
00:03:57,150 --> 00:04:02,430
for this one which is washing clothes when you wash clothes you say you're doing laundry What are you

64
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:03,550
doing laundry.

65
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:05,240
I need to do laundry today.

66
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:07,470
We don't usually say I need to wash my clothes.

67
00:04:07,470 --> 00:04:09,170
We usually say I need to do laundry.

68
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:10,260
It's a chore.

69
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:11,820
It's a kind of housework.

70
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:12,920
Is it an errand.

71
00:04:12,930 --> 00:04:13,550
No.

72
00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:19,050
Buying detergent at the supermarket would be an errand because you say to yourself I need detergent.

73
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:20,760
Go out you buy it come back.

74
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:23,280
That's an error in doing the laundry at home.

75
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:26,060
That is a chore that is housework.

76
00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:33,270
And then softener is something that you put in to the washing machine with the detergent to make the

77
00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:34,700
clothes softer.

78
00:04:34,770 --> 00:04:36,700
So they usually go together.

79
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:37,460
They work together.

80
00:04:37,470 --> 00:04:42,540
When you do laundry you use detergent and fabric softener.

81
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:43,790
So these are just some keywords.

82
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,310
I want you to keep in mind.

83
00:04:45,330 --> 00:04:49,320
And again we'll go through some specific examples later on in the lesson.
