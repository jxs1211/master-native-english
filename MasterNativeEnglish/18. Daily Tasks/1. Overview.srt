00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:10,440
In the last lesson we talked about emails writing emails and how we can write different types of emails

2
00:00:10,470 --> 00:00:12,290
for different purposes.

3
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:18,570
In this lesson we're going to talk about daily tasks things we need to do on a daily basis.

4
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:25,020
For example running errands or doing chores and we'll talk about both of those later on in the lesson.

5
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:28,080
So in this class we're going to cover some keywords first.

6
00:00:28,110 --> 00:00:33,570
Then I'm going to talk about some tips to keep in mind when you're describing tasks that you need to

7
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:40,890
do on a daily basis on a daily basis and then we'll go into errands and I'll explain what that means

8
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:47,250
exactly and we'll give an example we'll do a couple of examples of running errands which is also a very

9
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:49,650
very important part of many of our lives.

10
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:52,530
Probably everyone watching this has done errands.

11
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:59,640
At some point unless you're a king or something queen but an errand is something that all of us do and

12
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:04,330
we need to know how to describe the errands that we run.

13
00:01:04,410 --> 00:01:06,950
And if you don't know what that means now that's OK.

14
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:07,810
You will soon.

15
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:08,460
Let's begin.
