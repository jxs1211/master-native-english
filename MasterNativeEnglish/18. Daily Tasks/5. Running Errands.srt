1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:03,630
So we've talked about a common household chore doing laundry.

2
00:00:03,630 --> 00:00:07,290
Now let's talk about an errand I mentioned we would talk about errands.

3
00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:12,700
Things that we have to do things that we plan to do usually before we go out.

4
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:17,880
And these are usually things that are fairly quick they don't last a long time.

5
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:20,370
And we have to go out to do them.

6
00:00:20,370 --> 00:00:21,660
We don't do them at home.

7
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:27,360
They're not chores although they're similar to chores in the sense that they're kind of daily things.

8
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:29,630
Things we usually need to do.

9
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:35,210
There are a couple of common or a few common phrases that we can use when we're describing errands.

10
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:38,230
When we're talking about errands I want to make sure they're clear.

11
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:41,580
Number one pickup pickup means to get.

12
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:43,190
Same as get.

13
00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:47,330
Sometimes it means by sometimes it means take something away from.

14
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:50,880
So we might pick up some bread from the supermarket.

15
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:58,350
Of course you're picking it up but we often use pickup for a lot of different things to mean get which

16
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:06,650
could include buying or maybe not because you could say I need to pick up my friend from the train station.

17
00:01:06,660 --> 00:01:08,610
Does that mean you need to pick them up.

18
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:11,060
No you're going to drive to the train station.

19
00:01:11,130 --> 00:01:17,100
Wait and then they're maybe going to get in the car with you pick up my friend at the airport pick up

20
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:23,790
some groceries pick up a few books at the library books you're not buying at the library you are renting

21
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:29,670
them renting books at the library so it doesn't mean buy although it can suggest buy.

22
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:32,890
This is very common very very common.

23
00:01:32,890 --> 00:01:33,090
OK.

24
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:37,630
And actually it's used much more often than buy and grab is used.

25
00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:41,620
These actually these three are used very much the same way.

26
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:44,430
Hey I'm going to go to the supermarket.

27
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:44,850
Oh really.

28
00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:52,950
Could you Could you grab me a coke could you please grab me a Coke grab is probably more for buying

29
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:58,670
stuff and getting stuff pickup is a little bit more common for people I think.

30
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:04,100
So you you wouldn't as often say I need to grab my friend from the train station.

31
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:08,900
You'd probably say I need to pick up my friend from the train station.

32
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:13,230
Could you say get my friend from the train station or get my friend at the airport.

33
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:15,300
Yeah you definitely can.

34
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:18,330
Could you get me a candy bar at the supermarket.

35
00:02:18,330 --> 00:02:18,650
Yes.

36
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:19,460
That's OK.

37
00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:22,310
I need to get some books at the library.

38
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:22,690
Yes.

39
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:26,890
OK so generally speaking these three are very much the same.

40
00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:32,500
So now buy looks a little bit silly because it's so specific.

41
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:33,900
And of course you can use it.

42
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:36,600
I need to go buy some hairspray.

43
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:39,000
I need to go buy some fruit.

44
00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:39,430
OK.

45
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:40,260
That's fine.

46
00:02:40,290 --> 00:02:41,250
That's fine.

47
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:46,790
But I really like to use these three because they can be used in so many other ways.

48
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:49,790
We can't buy our friend at the airport.

49
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:51,000
That would be weird.

50
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,380
We can't we can't generally buy our kids from school.

51
00:02:54,390 --> 00:02:55,380
That would be very weird.

52
00:02:55,380 --> 00:02:57,860
Or buy some books from the library.

53
00:02:57,870 --> 00:02:58,530
No way.

54
00:02:58,530 --> 00:03:02,600
So yeah this is fine but it's just more specific.

55
00:03:02,610 --> 00:03:03,190
OK.

56
00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:11,040
Now should we use pay for what we use pay for not to get stuff usually but if we have for example a

57
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:20,820
bill a bill that we need to go out to pay I need to go to maybe the computer repair shop to pay for

58
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:30,570
the repair job that they did for me last week or I need to go to the maybe auto body shop to pay for

59
00:03:30,570 --> 00:03:34,110
the work that they're doing on my car or to pay a bill.

60
00:03:34,110 --> 00:03:40,810
OK whatever but this is just to give people money and it's usually not focused on getting some thing.

61
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:48,770
If we're getting something like it like candy or groceries or fruit we'll probably use these for.

62
00:03:48,810 --> 00:03:52,870
OK stop by means to go to a place for a short time.

63
00:03:52,890 --> 00:03:56,880
I'm going to stop by my grandma's house and just say hi.

64
00:03:56,970 --> 00:04:00,760
Now sometimes that could mean we're going to stay for a while.

65
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:02,320
Could be an hour or two.

66
00:04:02,370 --> 00:04:05,040
Sometimes we do use it that way.

67
00:04:05,070 --> 00:04:13,660
Please please stop by any time that means come over anytime visit anytime.

68
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:17,670
Maybe your friend says that hey stop by any time we can watch a movie.

69
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:18,440
Whatever.

70
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:19,710
Stop by anytime.

71
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:20,310
OK.

72
00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:26,820
It's often used to describe something that happens in a short time but it can be used for something

73
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:28,120
that happens longer.

74
00:04:28,170 --> 00:04:35,380
The more typical way to use this and the way I usually use it is when I am running errands.

75
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:38,000
I use stopped by to say where I need to go.

76
00:04:38,010 --> 00:04:46,710
I need to stop by the library to pick up a few books.

77
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:51,290
OK I need to stop by the library to pick up a few books.

78
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:52,940
Now what about run to.

79
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:55,220
I mean we need to run to a place.

80
00:04:55,230 --> 00:05:01,680
No but it does give it a feeling of kind of being in a hurry going somewhere in a hurry.

81
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,170
But it doesn't have to be.

82
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:06,480
We often just use it to mean I need to go there.

83
00:05:06,570 --> 00:05:12,460
I need to go there but usually we use it when we're talking about the errands that we need to run.

84
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:13,170
Listen to that.

85
00:05:13,170 --> 00:05:14,190
Running errands.

86
00:05:14,190 --> 00:05:15,780
Are we running errands.

87
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:16,100
No.

88
00:05:16,110 --> 00:05:21,330
But there is a feeling of not going to a place and hanging out.

89
00:05:21,330 --> 00:05:27,040
Not going to a shopping center and saying oh I don't know maybe I'll just walk around for three hours.

90
00:05:27,150 --> 00:05:35,460
When we talk about an errand we usually have a clear purpose a direction a goal and usually time is

91
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:37,000
a little bit tight.

92
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:41,290
Again it doesn't really mean we're running but it does have a feeling of OK.

93
00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:41,790
Let's go.

94
00:05:41,810 --> 00:05:44,060
Let's do it and then let's leave.

95
00:05:44,070 --> 00:05:47,020
We don't need to waste time.

96
00:05:47,190 --> 00:05:54,780
For example I need to run to the coffee shop nearby to get some coffee beans because we're out.

97
00:05:54,810 --> 00:05:56,620
It's a very common phrase by the way.

98
00:05:56,670 --> 00:06:01,110
We're out for we're running low.

99
00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:02,850
That means we're almost out.

100
00:06:02,850 --> 00:06:03,690
We have none.

101
00:06:03,690 --> 00:06:05,320
We're running low on coffee beans.

102
00:06:05,330 --> 00:06:07,210
I need to stop by the coffee shop.

103
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:11,060
I need to run to the coffee shop to grab some of those.

104
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:13,130
Because we're almost out.

105
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:18,770
So these phrases are all really common and we're going to see them in the example that we're going to

106
00:06:18,770 --> 00:06:25,100
look at now for running an errand and I'd like you to make sure next time you're describing your own

107
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:30,010
errands that you use these phrases because they're all super duper common.
