1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:02,820
So now let's actually practice this a little bit.

2
00:00:02,820 --> 00:00:10,920
I'm going to give you part of a synopsis synopsis is a basic overview basic outline of what happened

3
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:13,830
in a movie or a TV series.

4
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:16,630
OK we're just going to do that for a little bit.

5
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:21,810
A short one and then I'm going to also include some of my opinions about it.

6
00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:26,400
We're going to use some of the words and phrases that we've learned in this lesson.

7
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:35,490
And we're also going to describe how we feel about different parts of this particular TV series.

8
00:00:35,490 --> 00:00:36,910
So here's the example.

9
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:41,300
SIMON X plays so Simon x is the actor right.

10
00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:49,230
Simon x plays a heartbroken doctor named Kyle a heartbroken doctor named kyle in the new series.

11
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:50,580
Blah blah blah blah.

12
00:00:50,580 --> 00:00:51,750
Have you ever heard of blah blah blah blah.

13
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:52,310
That's good.

14
00:00:52,740 --> 00:01:00,660
At the start of the series he is struggling to cope with the death of his wife cope with means deal

15
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:03,270
with if somebody dies that's very painful.

16
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:04,520
It's very sad right.

17
00:01:04,570 --> 00:01:07,800
If you cope with it you're dealing with that loss.

18
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:10,090
He's struggling to cope with the death of his wife.

19
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:13,320
Anyway he gets a new job at a good hospital.

20
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:15,810
So we're just giving some details what happens.

21
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:19,440
Basically this is what we would call a synopsis.

22
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:26,810
He gets a new job at a good hospital and gets a reputation for being very fair minded and caring.

23
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:28,860
So now we can say something about his character.

24
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:30,680
Now we're talking about who he is.

25
00:01:30,690 --> 00:01:37,580
Now we go into a bit of a review because the best part about this series is him right.

26
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:39,950
And so we can talk about why we like him.

27
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:42,100
He's a really likable main character.

28
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:49,200
And even though his story is quite tragic tragic means very sad very sad story even though his story

29
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,490
is quite tragic.

30
00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:53,530
He's got a great sense of humor.

31
00:01:53,550 --> 00:01:54,750
That means he's funny.

32
00:01:54,810 --> 00:01:56,700
That doesn't mean it's a comedy.

33
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:58,410
It just means he's funny.

34
00:01:58,410 --> 00:02:00,930
Maybe it's a drama but he is funny.

35
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,310
He's got a great sense of humor.

36
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:10,590
He's always quick to use a sarcastic remark with his colleagues a sarcastic remark sarcasm is or sarcasm

37
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:18,300
is a very important part of American humor and other humor I guess in an English speaking culture.

38
00:02:18,330 --> 00:02:22,860
So basically it means something bad happened and I say Oh great.

39
00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:26,840
So you kind of say the opposite thing to what you really mean.

40
00:02:26,850 --> 00:02:32,040
OK so a sarcastic remark with his colleagues the people he works with.

41
00:02:32,070 --> 00:02:36,680
So we've kind of mixed here the synopsis or a little bit of a synopsis.

42
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:44,220
What happens with the reason we liked the series which is the main character he's a likable main character.

43
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:48,710
And then we talk about why that is maybe because of his own loss.

44
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:54,120
He's able to sympathize with people who are struggling and console them.

45
00:02:54,210 --> 00:02:59,150
So to sympathize means you understand how other people feel.

46
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:01,230
You show them that you care about them.

47
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:02,940
You sympathize with them.

48
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:10,470
You feel there may be pain they're suffering their sorrow and console them if you console someone you

49
00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:13,940
make them feel better or you try to make them feel better.

50
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:19,290
It's ok you can console people in many different ways but that's what it means to try to make them feel

51
00:03:19,290 --> 00:03:19,890
better.

52
00:03:19,890 --> 00:03:23,460
So my favorite part of the whole series is his character.

53
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:24,630
That's what I like about it.

54
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:27,910
My favorite part of the whole series is his character.

55
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:36,000
The only thing I don't really like is that many of the episode plots are a bit repetitive and predictable.

56
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,390
So that means maybe every one every story is different.

57
00:03:39,390 --> 00:03:48,090
Same characters but sometimes what happens in each episode is too similar to what happened in a previous

58
00:03:48,090 --> 00:03:48,840
episode.

59
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:54,070
So I feel like OK I've already seen this kind of story.

60
00:03:54,210 --> 00:04:01,230
It's getting a bit repetitive that means something happens again and again it repeats it's very predictable.

61
00:04:01,230 --> 00:04:05,950
If you can predict something it means you know what's going to happen next.

62
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,450
It is a bit predictable predictable.

63
00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:12,220
I would still recommend it though I would still recommend it though.

64
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:17,640
That means even though there is something I don't like about it I like it enough to say that you should

65
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:18,550
watch it.

66
00:04:18,570 --> 00:04:20,180
I would still recommend it.

67
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:29,130
OK so this is just a simple example of a basic synopsis and a review of why we like the series and something

68
00:04:29,130 --> 00:04:30,660
about why we don't like it.

69
00:04:30,810 --> 00:04:31,140
All right.

70
00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:36,840
So to really get a feeling for this you can talk with your friends about it but first you should practice

71
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:42,480
it so you can do it maybe as a recording or if you have a friend you can talk with movie's about.

72
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:44,460
Try it with them.

73
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:49,740
I want you to talk about a TV series or movie that you've seen recently.

74
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:55,980
Explain the premise or the basic story what it's about without giving away every detail.

75
00:04:55,980 --> 00:04:59,000
So just do a basic synopsis of the story OK.

76
00:04:59,190 --> 00:05:05,100
And then also describe the main character and some of the good things and the bad things some of the

77
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:08,450
positives and the negatives about the story.

78
00:05:08,490 --> 00:05:13,410
I practice this and when you get used to describing movies and saying what you like and what you don't

79
00:05:13,410 --> 00:05:20,460
like you'll find it a lot easier to have discussions with friends about movies and TV and that's one

80
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:24,910
of the most common topics there is which people like to talk about.

81
00:05:25,050 --> 00:05:25,860
Correct.

82
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:26,250
All right.

83
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:26,640
Good luck.
