1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:05,250
So let's first just go through a couple of really useful words that we can use when we're talking about

2
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:12,320
movies and TV and also how we can actually put some of them together to explain what we want to explain.

3
00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:12,910
OK.

4
00:00:12,930 --> 00:00:20,220
So first very quickly let's just go through these the plot the plot of a movie is basically what happens

5
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:26,070
in the story line that the story follows the points along the way in the story.

6
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:31,390
This is this is the plot doesn't have to be a movie doesn't have to be a TV series.

7
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:37,680
But when you're if you need to when you're explaining what happens in a movie or a video game or whatever

8
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:41,630
to your friends you're actually explaining the plot to them.

9
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:42,080
OK.

10
00:00:42,150 --> 00:00:49,140
The characters are the people who are in the video game or the movie or the TV series not real people.

11
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:56,490
They're not the actual person that they are they're playing a character the actor or actress plays the

12
00:00:56,490 --> 00:00:57,790
character.

13
00:00:57,790 --> 00:01:04,320
I have actors I need to put also actresses Here the actor or actress plays the character and the character

14
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:06,850
is the one in the story.

15
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:11,280
The trailer is what you see before the movie comes out.

16
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:18,450
So when you talk about a movie we say blah blah blah is coming out soon it's coming out soon.

17
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:21,930
I can't wait until whatever movie comes out.

18
00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:27,620
I can't wait until it comes out because because I saw the trailer and the trailer is so good.

19
00:01:27,660 --> 00:01:29,120
Can you say preview.

20
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:29,570
Yes.

21
00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:30,900
If you want to say preview.

22
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:32,120
That's OK.

23
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:35,910
So some people would say that the trailer is different than the preview.

24
00:01:35,910 --> 00:01:39,840
People often just use trailer and preview to mean both.

25
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:44,840
There is often a difference in how long they are but it's not really that important.

26
00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:47,880
People use these pretty much to mean the same thing.

27
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:52,800
I can't I can't wait to see.

28
00:01:52,940 --> 00:01:57,960
I'm not going to say a name here because if you're watching this 30 years from when it's recorded then

29
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:00,900
this whole series will look ridiculous.

30
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:10,800
I can't wait to see blah blah blah movie name because the trailer looks great or awesome great or awesome

31
00:02:10,890 --> 00:02:12,120
or whatever you want to say.

32
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:12,820
OK.

33
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:15,630
Can't wait means you're very excited for that.

34
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:16,920
Yeah OK.

35
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:18,510
So that's how you would describe that.

36
00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:19,980
So what about series.

37
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:22,260
Can we use it for movies and TV.

38
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:30,600
The answer is yes you can say my favorite TV series is you can say my favorite series of movies is but

39
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:32,760
it has to be more than one movie.

40
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:38,820
And usually it's many movies for example the Harry Potter movie series.

41
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:41,550
People often call it a series of movies.

42
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:43,930
I love the Harry Potter series.

43
00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:48,190
In fact that can also be used for the Harry Potter books.

44
00:02:48,490 --> 00:02:53,700
OK now for TV we often call the show itself a series.

45
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:56,610
Sometimes people use show sometimes they use series.

46
00:02:56,610 --> 00:03:03,600
Many people use the word show when each one is completely unrelated to the others.

47
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:06,030
Every single one is completely different.

48
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:13,230
Maybe it's a game show or maybe it's a show where you just have a different sort of topic for each episode

49
00:03:13,290 --> 00:03:14,850
which we'll talk about next.

50
00:03:14,850 --> 00:03:19,330
But for a TV series it's usually a continuous story.

51
00:03:19,350 --> 00:03:27,000
One story that has multiple seasons and the season is one year for that show or that series.

52
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:33,690
So if we're talking about a TV series where maybe every episode the next thing is happening based on

53
00:03:33,690 --> 00:03:34,910
the previous one.

54
00:03:35,010 --> 00:03:37,870
And we have some some characters who are all the same.

55
00:03:37,950 --> 00:03:44,220
And there's one story there is there's one kind of line or plot that's moving along.

56
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:48,710
And then in this season you'll have a very exciting ending.

57
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:52,430
And then you say oh I can't wait until next season.

58
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:55,350
I can't I can't wait.

59
00:03:55,740 --> 00:04:05,730
I can't wait until Season 9 to come out to your waiting and you're waiting and you're waiting because

60
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:12,450
you've seen seasons one through eight and the story's really interesting and you've fallen in love with

61
00:04:12,450 --> 00:04:13,510
all the characters.

62
00:04:13,530 --> 00:04:20,130
That means you just really like the characters and each little story within each one of those is called

63
00:04:20,130 --> 00:04:20,850
an episode.

64
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:23,580
That's what an episode is usually.

65
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:30,570
Episodes are used for TV not used for movies but there are some examples where episodes are actually

66
00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:38,520
used for movies too like Star Wars Episode 1 episode 2 episode 3 an episode as each piece of that.

67
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:45,240
So we could say an episode each little contained story is this big season is this big and the whole

68
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:47,330
series is this big.

69
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:48,640
This is the whole thing.

70
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:57,030
So now let's talk about how we can actually use actors and actresses their names and connect them to

71
00:04:57,510 --> 00:05:04,910
the TV shows or movies they're in so we could say stars in or plays as I mentioned before we can use

72
00:05:04,910 --> 00:05:05,650
plays.

73
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:08,880
So let's say let's choose a person here.

74
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:15,140
Let's say Hugh Jackman Hugh Jackman as an actor.

75
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:16,260
That's a real person.

76
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:21,830
Stars in a movie or the movie called Wolverine.

77
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:23,290
So I'm just going to fill this in here.

78
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:28,610
Hugh Jackman stars in a movie called what's going on right here Wolverine.

79
00:05:28,610 --> 00:05:29,900
That's the name of the movie.

80
00:05:30,090 --> 00:05:32,640
I didn't really like the movie by the way.

81
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:35,140
Anyway it was OK no it wasn't.

82
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:35,930
It wasn't that good.

83
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:37,760
OK.

84
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:41,430
Hugh Jackman stars in a movie called Wolverine which is set in.

85
00:05:41,510 --> 00:05:46,150
And then you can say where it takes place or when it takes place.

86
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:53,780
Or you could just say Hugh Jackman stars in and then you could cancel all of this and just say Wolverine

87
00:05:54,290 --> 00:06:00,710
and then instead of saying which is set in saying where it takes place you could say which is about

88
00:06:00,890 --> 00:06:05,750
a mutant who lives for a very long time and blah blah blah.

89
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:07,490
You can talk about the story.

90
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:11,470
Now let's use a classic example let's use Kate Winslet.

91
00:06:11,510 --> 00:06:15,760
OK so Kate Winslet a very good very good actress.

92
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:19,280
OK let's use Kate Winslet plays.

93
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:20,010
OK.

94
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:22,850
Now we could say something about the character.

95
00:06:22,850 --> 00:06:30,680
So this one the plays allows us to describe a little bit the character in the movie or TV series plays

96
00:06:30,710 --> 00:06:33,830
a young rich girl.

97
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:37,250
So abbreviate that as young rich girl.

98
00:06:37,310 --> 00:06:45,410
Why are g if anyone ever asks you what is why are g me now you know plays a young rich girl named you

99
00:06:45,410 --> 00:06:47,570
know the name classic movie Rose.

100
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:50,380
OK Rose who.

101
00:06:50,690 --> 00:06:51,890
What does she do.

102
00:06:51,890 --> 00:06:59,360
Falls in love with a young man named Jack in the classic film Titanic.

103
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:04,730
So this is the structure that we can use and again you can say this whole thing or you can cancel it

104
00:07:04,850 --> 00:07:06,390
which is also very common.

105
00:07:06,410 --> 00:07:14,780
This person stars in this which is about or this person plays a that other character details named character

106
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:18,540
name who then something the character does in the movie.

107
00:07:18,590 --> 00:07:24,680
Then you could say in the film Titanic or in Titanic you can just say in Titanic.

108
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:32,720
So this is very simply how you can describe characters and the actors or actresses who play those characters

109
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:35,200
in films and TV series.

110
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:36,200
Very very common.

111
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:39,380
There's a word here that I didn't mentioned before because I forgot.

112
00:07:39,380 --> 00:07:42,710
So let me just tell you what that one means that is sequel.

113
00:07:42,710 --> 00:07:51,710
OK sequel a sequel is one a movie usually that comes after another the original.

114
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:56,990
So you have the original and let's say we're talking about the movie bad boys.

115
00:07:56,990 --> 00:07:58,550
I've never actually seen it.

116
00:07:58,550 --> 00:07:59,750
It's a pretty old movie.

117
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:00,570
I've never seen it.

118
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:01,030
OK.

119
00:08:01,070 --> 00:08:06,310
So the original is just called Bad Boys because they don't know if they're going to make another movie.

120
00:08:06,410 --> 00:08:08,230
But then it's very successful.

121
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:13,760
It has huge box office success.

122
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:19,060
Actually I don't know if this movie had huge box office success just choosing this example.

123
00:08:19,070 --> 00:08:22,520
That means that it was very successful and made a lot of money.

124
00:08:22,530 --> 00:08:22,860
OK.

125
00:08:22,910 --> 00:08:25,670
Was a very big movie that made a lot of money.

126
00:08:25,670 --> 00:08:28,030
This is sometimes called a blockbuster.

127
00:08:28,070 --> 00:08:31,670
A very big movie maybe a superhero movie makes a lot of money.

128
00:08:31,670 --> 00:08:32,510
Huge movie.

129
00:08:32,510 --> 00:08:33,560
It's a blockbuster.

130
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:37,670
OK so this is the original and then oh it did very well.

131
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:38,600
Very successful.

132
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:39,380
Everybody likes it.

133
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:41,080
So we're going to come out with another one.

134
00:08:41,090 --> 00:08:45,500
We're going to come out with a sequel a sequel.

135
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:46,920
What will it be called.

136
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:48,640
How about bad boys too.

137
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:53,510
Notice that it's often written like this instead of writing bad boys too.

138
00:08:53,570 --> 00:08:56,320
Sometimes it's written like this.

139
00:08:56,450 --> 00:09:02,330
And if you want to do your own research about this I don't want to teach you all these because it's

140
00:09:02,330 --> 00:09:04,040
not that useful.

141
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:11,510
These are called Roman numerals and u m e r a l s good research Roman numerals and learn it.

142
00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:17,570
So when you maybe are in America and you see the Super Bowl is going on and it shows one of these big

143
00:09:17,570 --> 00:09:19,490
numbers it's a Roman numeral.

144
00:09:19,490 --> 00:09:20,730
You'll know what it means.

145
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:22,820
Pretty simple actually pretty easy to learn.

146
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:23,900
Takes ten minutes.

147
00:09:23,930 --> 00:09:33,950
So the sequel of Bad Boys 2 was just as good as the original the sequel of Bad Boys 2 was not nearly

148
00:09:34,190 --> 00:09:38,910
as good as the original was just as good as the original.

149
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:40,170
Not nearly as good.

150
00:09:40,190 --> 00:09:41,300
What the sequel.

151
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:42,340
The sequel.

152
00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:49,820
The sequel if it comes before sometimes we have what we call a prequel and a prequel a prequel is made

153
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:54,690
after but it's about what happens before it's made after.

154
00:09:54,710 --> 00:10:00,730
But it's about what happens earlier maybe to the characters when they were young star wars would be

155
00:10:01,270 --> 00:10:02,920
a good example of that.
