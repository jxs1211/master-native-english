1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:01,320
So what is a genre.

2
00:00:01,350 --> 00:00:06,230
Well this genre is a type or a kind of something that's what it is.

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:08,010
We use it not for everything.

4
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:10,930
We don't say a genre of fruit for example.

5
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:12,680
We don't use it for objects.

6
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:15,330
We use it usually for movies.

7
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:17,340
We use it for TV.

8
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:25,980
Similar entertainment videos online literature books other types of other types of literature and we

9
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:27,180
use it for music.

10
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:33,570
Now the ones that we use for literature and movies or literature and TV series they're often the same

11
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:38,550
not in every case but they're often the same or similar music.

12
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:41,530
Of course the genres are very very different.

13
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:47,610
You do not have for example rock and roll literature.

14
00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:49,230
That would be very silly.

15
00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:50,930
That would be a genre of music.

16
00:00:51,050 --> 00:00:51,680
OK.

17
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:57,650
So let's talk about some of the common movie genres and we can we can use them in different ways.

18
00:00:57,660 --> 00:01:02,950
Let's just go through what they mean and what kind of movie they represent.

19
00:01:02,950 --> 00:01:05,430
OK so let's first talk about action.

20
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:11,670
One of the interesting things about genres is sometimes one part of a genre can stand by itself but

21
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:17,430
you often see them put together for example if we look at action and adventure you can have an action

22
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:26,460
movie a movie with a lot of car chases for example maybe a car chase a movie with maybe explosions or

23
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:26,970
war.

24
00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:32,610
This would be an action movie maybe a lot of kung fu or fighting but an action adventure movie is a

25
00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:35,040
little bit a little bit more than that.

26
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:41,400
It maybe has a maybe a story where the characters go somewhere far away and do something crazy.

27
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:47,640
So there's action but there's also adventure pop action adventure so we mix these up in fact now romantic

28
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:49,320
comedy is similar.

29
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:55,790
So if we said a romantic film a romantic film that could go by itself sometimes romance.

30
00:01:55,800 --> 00:02:03,300
But that's usually used for literature then a romantic comedy is also very common which is funny.

31
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:07,320
Comedy means means it's funny and you can have comedy by itself.

32
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:12,710
So if it's just supposed to make you laugh and that's the point of the movie it's a comedy.

33
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:19,580
OK but if it has a love story as well and it's funny then it's a romantic comedy.

34
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:24,250
Now if it's just a love story and it's a very serious and it's not funny at all.

35
00:02:24,330 --> 00:02:26,620
Well maybe maybe it's a drama.

36
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:31,230
So we often hear TV drama a drama is usually more serious.

37
00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:32,830
It's not supposed to be funny.

38
00:02:32,850 --> 00:02:37,670
Maybe there are some funny things in it but that's not what it's about right.

39
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,810
All right thriller and horror.

40
00:02:39,810 --> 00:02:46,380
So what's the difference between these these are two types of what we would call Scary scary movies

41
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:50,880
a movie that makes you feel scared might make you feel scared in different ways.

42
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:58,950
If there's a lot of blood and violence and torture and terrible things horrible things then we call

43
00:02:58,950 --> 00:03:01,200
it a horror film a horror film.

44
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:07,890
These are often a bit more maybe disgusting said Gee you're a bit more disgusting maybe there's a lot

45
00:03:07,890 --> 00:03:12,300
more blood a thriller may just be exciting.

46
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:19,230
So if you are watching a thriller movie maybe something suddenly jumps out and you go wow that's very

47
00:03:19,230 --> 00:03:19,740
exciting.

48
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:22,470
But it's not horror.

49
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:23,220
Exactly.

50
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:29,590
So they're both scary movies but they're kind of different in the style right sometimes maybe they're

51
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:30,110
mixed.

52
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:34,700
But a movie is usually either called a thriller or a horror movie.

53
00:03:34,710 --> 00:03:39,260
So what's the difference between sci fi or science fiction.

54
00:03:39,270 --> 00:03:45,100
This is also called science fiction and fantasy.

55
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:46,630
What's the difference.

56
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:53,320
Well science fiction or sci fi and it usually is called sci fi for movies although for maybe a novel

57
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:55,870
it's often called science fiction.

58
00:03:55,870 --> 00:04:04,300
The full name if it's a sci fi movie or a sci fi maybe novel it's about something that may be possible

59
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:08,770
but it's either in the future or it doesn't exist now.

60
00:04:08,770 --> 00:04:16,240
And it's some amazing technology or it involves space travel which again may be possible but we just

61
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:17,850
don't see it around us now.

62
00:04:17,860 --> 00:04:19,980
So crazy technology.

63
00:04:20,110 --> 00:04:23,780
Technology like laser guns and all that stuff.

64
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:26,290
Alien space travel.

65
00:04:26,290 --> 00:04:32,890
This is usually sci fi fantasy is different because fantasy has magic in it.

66
00:04:32,890 --> 00:04:38,350
Maybe fantasy is about a very old world but it involves something magical.

67
00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:44,760
For example Harry Potter would be considered fantasy or maybe its action adventure fantasy.

68
00:04:44,770 --> 00:04:47,950
You could put all those together because it has magic.

69
00:04:47,950 --> 00:04:49,810
It's not about technology.

70
00:04:49,810 --> 00:04:56,350
So that's the difference between sci fi and fantasy although they sometimes are mixed and it's difficult

71
00:04:56,350 --> 00:04:57,960
to tell which one it is.

72
00:04:57,990 --> 00:05:04,630
Usually it'll be called either a sci fi movie or a fantasy movie even though sometimes they might be

73
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:06,270
close to the line.

74
00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:10,150
Then a documentary is anything that's about real life.

75
00:05:10,150 --> 00:05:14,500
That doesn't mean there can't be anything not real in it.

76
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:20,740
So for example if you watch a documentary maybe it's about a historical event something that happened

77
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:21,860
in history.

78
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:29,170
Maybe it's about a historical event and in the documentary there are some scenes that are done by actors

79
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:29,530
right.

80
00:05:29,530 --> 00:05:34,110
So we say it's dramatized but it's about a real event.

81
00:05:34,270 --> 00:05:35,830
Or maybe it's about animals.

82
00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:41,350
If it's a story about animals who speak then OK it's not but if it's about real animals and they're

83
00:05:41,350 --> 00:05:48,520
saying all the animals this time of you that eat the grass and that kind of movie that is a documentary

84
00:05:48,970 --> 00:05:52,900
documentary TV series documentary movie.

85
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:59,590
I personally like documentaries very much because I think it's a good way to learn about interesting

86
00:05:59,590 --> 00:06:02,490
topics that I can't really see every day.

87
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:08,430
I can't always go to Africa and look at lions hunting other animals in the wild.

88
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:09,070
Right.

89
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:14,320
So a documentary is a good way to kind of experience that and learn about it.

90
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:16,730
These are not all the genres that you'll see.

91
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:20,940
You'll see others as well and you'll see them mixed around in other ways too.

92
00:06:20,950 --> 00:06:25,960
But I want you to just be aware of some of the very common genres and how we talk about them.

93
00:06:26,050 --> 00:06:32,650
Next we'll talk about some specific phrases we can use when we're describing movies and the people who

94
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:33,970
are in the movies.
