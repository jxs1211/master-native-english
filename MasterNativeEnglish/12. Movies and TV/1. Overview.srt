00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:10,100
In the last lesson we talked about how to order food obviously very very important.

2
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:15,240
And in this lesson we're going to talk about something maybe a little more fun but also something that

3
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:18,390
comes up very very often in daily conversations.

4
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:24,300
We're going to talk about how to talk about movies and TV shows.

5
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:28,490
First we're going to just go through some basic genres of movies.

6
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:30,630
Yes genres of movies.

7
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:31,920
I'll explain what that means.

8
00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:37,200
If you don't know and then we're going to talk about some useful phrases we can use when we're describing

9
00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:43,870
movies and TV shows or TV series then we're going to go over what exactly a review is.

10
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:51,840
In fact when we talk about movies and TV shows we are giving reviews when we recommend movies and TV

11
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:53,060
shows to friends.

12
00:00:53,070 --> 00:01:00,360
We are kind of giving a review of that movie making a comment about it good or bad and then we're going

13
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:02,080
to actually look at some examples.

14
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:04,590
How can we describe a movie.

15
00:01:04,590 --> 00:01:10,350
Basically this is called a synopsis and then how can we connect a review to that.

16
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:10,600
All right.

17
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:16,560
So let's get started and talk first about some basic movie generals.
