1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:05,400
When we talk about movies with friends We're really recommending whether or not a friend should see

2
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:08,230
a movie that we've seen and they have not.

3
00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:09,000
Right.

4
00:00:09,060 --> 00:00:10,390
We're giving reviews.

5
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:12,870
That's what we're doing actually.

6
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:18,090
So you need to know how to even if you're not a professional movie reviewer.

7
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:23,730
You need to know how to review a movie because again that's how you recommend movies.

8
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:25,170
You say what you like.

9
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:26,600
You say what you didn't like.

10
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:30,210
And sometimes it's more bad stuff than good stuff.

11
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:36,870
Sometimes it's more good stuff than bad stuff more positive or more negative.

12
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:41,850
More prose or more cons it's the same thing.

13
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:44,730
We can say often pros and cons very common.

14
00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:50,760
OK so let's talk about some different phrases we can use when we're talking about movies we like or

15
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:54,120
things about movies we like things about movies we don't like.

16
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:57,010
Notice that this is all mixed up.

17
00:00:57,060 --> 00:01:05,580
The thing I liked about the movie is my favorite part is the most memorable thing is can we say was

18
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:13,590
Yeah we can look at look at this one was terrible didn't make sense it was stupid.

19
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:20,940
I mixed these up because often when people talk about movies they can use either the present tense or

20
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:22,320
the past tense.

21
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:28,560
So in the story the main character is very very selfish very very greedy.

22
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:34,410
He is that way or if you wanted to say it you could say he was really greedy in the movie.

23
00:01:34,410 --> 00:01:38,750
Actually more often people will use is they'll use the present tense.

24
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:43,980
And then when they're talking about their memory of it whether or not it was good or bad they'll use

25
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:45,600
the past tense.

26
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,700
So you can kind of mix it up.

27
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:50,010
It's all kind of okay.

28
00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:56,490
But usually when you're when you're talking about the story you kind of have to pick one and stay with

29
00:01:56,490 --> 00:01:57,230
it.

30
00:01:57,300 --> 00:02:03,730
So you should be consistent but it usually doesn't matter which one you choose.

31
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:10,390
And often again often when we describe the story the plot basically what happened.

32
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:11,810
We use the present tense.

33
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:12,430
Very common.

34
00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:13,040
OK.

35
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:21,780
The thing I liked about the movie is the action so realistic so fast paced so cool whatever you want

36
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:22,590
to say.

37
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:29,910
The thing I liked about the movie is maybe how real it felt.

38
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:31,590
That means it feels like real life.

39
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:37,440
The thing I liked about the movie is how real it felt or how real it feels.

40
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:47,580
My favorite part is my favorite part is probably the acting the acting or we could say the performances

41
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:48,840
the performances.

42
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:50,640
You could say acting or performances.

43
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:57,180
That means the actors or actresses did a very good job playing their characters or my favorite part

44
00:02:57,270 --> 00:02:59,970
is maybe a specific person.

45
00:02:59,970 --> 00:03:06,150
Let's let's use Kate Winslet Kate Winslet s height Kate Winslet s performance.

46
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:08,650
My favorite part is Kate Winslet s performance.

47
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:11,250
You can choose a specific person if you want to.

48
00:03:11,290 --> 00:03:17,400
OK maybe my favorite part is or my favorite part was the music.

49
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:21,980
The soundtrack is amazing or was amazing.

50
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:23,670
The soundtrack is amazing.

51
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:25,750
This is the music that plays over it.

52
00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:32,120
Probably the most memorable thing memorable means the thing you remember most.

53
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:38,430
So this isn't always a positive thing but usually if something is memorable we're using it to describe

54
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:40,710
a thing that we think is is good is positive.

55
00:03:40,710 --> 00:03:48,540
The most memorable thing is maybe the dialogue to see you could read that or write it up here D I A

56
00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:52,450
L O G you e which is what people are saying.

57
00:03:52,500 --> 00:04:00,420
People talking in the story the dialogue is probably the most memorable thing in this movie or was probably

58
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:02,840
the most memorable thing in this movie.

59
00:04:02,970 --> 00:04:08,610
Whatever it was about the dialogue very well written it stuck in your brain.

60
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:09,960
It's memorable.

61
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:11,580
Let's look at some negative things.

62
00:04:11,610 --> 00:04:12,240
OK.

63
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:13,890
I thought the acting was terrible.

64
00:04:13,950 --> 00:04:15,520
So we use acting here.

65
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:18,660
I thought the performances were terrible.

66
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:23,200
Now if you use performances because it s e s then we have to say were terrible.

67
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:26,910
I thought the performances were terrible really not good.

68
00:04:26,910 --> 00:04:33,720
Very all the characters were very two dimensional two dimensional characters two dimensional.

69
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:35,010
That means not realistic.

70
00:04:35,010 --> 00:04:38,250
So if we said oh so real so realistic.

71
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:42,290
OK but if it's not very realistic then it's very two dimensional.

72
00:04:42,290 --> 00:04:49,620
D I M E N S I O and l the story didn't make sense.

73
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:52,880
The story didn't or doesn't make sense.

74
00:04:52,890 --> 00:04:57,840
That means if something doesn't make sense you can't really understand everything that happened because

75
00:04:57,870 --> 00:04:59,700
all the pieces don't really fit.

76
00:04:59,790 --> 00:05:00,450
Gather.

77
00:05:00,450 --> 00:05:01,350
Wait a minute.

78
00:05:01,350 --> 00:05:08,610
The main character was at the school but at the same time there was another scene when he was at the

79
00:05:08,670 --> 00:05:10,540
shopping center.

80
00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:12,300
I don't understand.

81
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:19,680
It doesn't make sense if something confuses you like that because either you don't understand it or

82
00:05:19,770 --> 00:05:21,860
maybe the writing was bad.

83
00:05:22,050 --> 00:05:24,690
Then you can say it doesn't make sense.

84
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:31,380
If I'm speaking to you and what I'm saying is difficult to understand either because I'm not saying

85
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:36,760
it clearly or because maybe you're very sleepy and you're not really paying attention.

86
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:37,330
Wake up.

87
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:41,960
You can say it doesn't make sense does it make sense.

88
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,420
This is hard to understand.

89
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,530
It doesn't make sense.

90
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:46,910
The ending was stupid.

91
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:51,480
I don't think I really need to explain this one but you can talk about different parts of the movie

92
00:05:51,660 --> 00:06:00,960
the middle the ending the part where so we can use the part where the part where and then describes

93
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:08,430
something that happened the part where they went to the planet and saved the children was stupid.

94
00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:09,720
That part was stupid.

95
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:11,760
The rest of the movie I liked.

96
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:14,940
It was a good movie but the part where they where they.

97
00:06:14,970 --> 00:06:17,850
And then say the action describe it a little bit.

98
00:06:17,850 --> 00:06:20,430
The part where they went to the planet to save the children.

99
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:22,210
That was kind of stupid.

100
00:06:22,230 --> 00:06:26,640
So you can talk about specific parts or you can talk about something like the end.

101
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:28,530
You could say it was a stupid movie.

102
00:06:28,530 --> 00:06:30,240
The whole thing was stupid.

103
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,560
That's OK too.

104
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:32,350
That's OK too.

105
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:36,720
It wasn't realistic it wasn't realistic.

106
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:42,580
It's a realistic is similar to real real is actually usually used as a noun.

107
00:06:42,690 --> 00:06:43,380
Sometimes not.

108
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:47,100
You can say the source so real so real it's like real.

109
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:54,620
So sometimes we use it that way but we often use this one instead which means like real realistic maps

110
00:06:54,630 --> 00:06:56,370
wasn't realistic.

111
00:06:56,370 --> 00:06:57,930
Stupid bad movie.

112
00:06:58,050 --> 00:07:04,020
So these are some common ways we can express things we like don't like about movies and you can use

113
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:05,440
these for TV series.

114
00:07:05,490 --> 00:07:09,240
In fact you can use these for books that you read as well.

115
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:14,910
You can use these for a lot of different things when you're explaining them to your friends to help

116
00:07:14,910 --> 00:07:20,760
them understand why they should or shouldn't watch that or read that or whatever.
