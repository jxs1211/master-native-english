1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:07,260
Now that we've gone through the common actions and phrases that we need to describe how to prepare a

2
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:13,090
particular food we can actually get into a real example before we do that.

3
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:19,290
I want to just cover for simple words that I think you probably already know but I just want to make

4
00:00:19,290 --> 00:00:20,790
sure these are very very clear.

5
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:29,060
Before we get into the example these are recipe dish servings and ingredients.

6
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:39,200
OK so very quickly the recipe is basically how to make that particular food whatever it may be.

7
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:47,850
It includes the actions descriptions of the actions as well as how much of each particular thing that

8
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:48,600
you need.

9
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:49,860
That's what a recipe is.

10
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:55,990
So how much I need and what I need to do with that amount of each thing.

11
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:57,000
Pretty simple.

12
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,320
That's usually the hard part.

13
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:00,490
It's basically like a computer program.

14
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:04,370
Do this and then do this with this much and then do this with this much.

15
00:01:04,410 --> 00:01:04,770
OK.

16
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:11,100
So you just follow it step by step and it usually includes some of the phrases that we were just talking

17
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:13,180
about after that's done.

18
00:01:13,230 --> 00:01:20,280
When you finish that or when it's golden brown ad then it will say an amount for example a tablespoon

19
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:28,350
a teaspoon a cup and different countries have different ways to measure things that are needed.

20
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:33,830
In America we often use cups we use tablespoons.

21
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:39,440
We don't usually use for example grams so much or or milligrams.

22
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:41,050
We don't use that as often.

23
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:48,060
OK then we have ingredients ingredients are the things that we actually put in what we're making the

24
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:54,030
vegetables the meat the spices all of the things that we need all the stuff.

25
00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:55,800
Those are the ingredients.

26
00:01:55,830 --> 00:02:05,760
So the ingredients go into the recipe and once we do the recipe then we have finished preparing a particular

27
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:07,080
dish.

28
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:13,680
So dish can be a little confusing one meaning of dish is something like a plate or a a bowl but one

29
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:17,430
meaning of dish is a particular type of food.

30
00:02:17,490 --> 00:02:19,390
So we're going to talk about the dish.

31
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:23,430
We're going to talk about is stir fried tomato and eggs.

32
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:26,310
It's a classic Chinese dish.

33
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:32,910
And maybe your country wherever you may be from has classic dishes things that everybody knows and maybe

34
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:38,880
everybody knows how to cook those dishes or maybe at least many people know how to cook those dishes.

35
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:41,590
Some people just cannot cook and that's OK too.

36
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:42,610
OK.

37
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:48,180
Now when you're preparing dishes using a recipe with ingredients you need to know how many people you're

38
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:49,400
going to have.

39
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:55,320
And the reason that you need to know that is because you may need more or less ingredients OK.

40
00:02:55,590 --> 00:03:02,720
So the way that we count how much we need to make is usually by using the word servings.

41
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:09,660
We might say three servings of this if you make for example a box of brownies or cake on the box on

42
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:11,890
the back it says four servings.

43
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:15,300
That generally means that it's enough for four people.

44
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:19,670
Now the way that that's exactly calculated and measured is not so clear.

45
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:24,170
But generally speaking we're talking about how many people are going to eat.

46
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:27,060
How many people need to eat that particular dish.

47
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:30,450
So how many servings do we need to make while 30 servings.

48
00:03:30,450 --> 00:03:32,260
We need a lot of ingredients.

49
00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:33,360
We need a lot of ingredients.

50
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,780
We're having a huge party tonight.

51
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:38,000
30 servings of whatever you're making.

52
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:38,410
OK.

53
00:03:38,550 --> 00:03:44,070
So I hope those four words are very clear because they're very important when it comes to describing

54
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:46,720
how to make a particular thing.

55
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:47,040
OK.

56
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:49,820
Now let's actually go into our recipe.
