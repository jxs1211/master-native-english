00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:06,810
So far we've been talking about cuisine and simple actions that we may need to do when we're going to

2
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:09,200
describe how to cook something.

3
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:16,050
Now we're going to continue with a few common phrases that we can use as we're describing the process

4
00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:20,250
of cooking before we actually get into an example recipe.

5
00:00:20,370 --> 00:00:21,120
OK.

6
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:23,210
Batter it in breadcrumbs.

7
00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:30,570
Now batter can be a verb or a noun but it means to completely cover something in what's called batter

8
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:34,680
batter batter is a mix of different different ingredients.

9
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:37,200
So batter it in bread crumbs.

10
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:44,010
So we're going to basically roll it around in the bread crumbs cook on low heat for 20 minutes.

11
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:49,980
So we often need to describe how hot the if we're using a burner for using a burner.

12
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:50,760
How hot that is.

13
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:57,240
We have low heat and I think you can probably guess we have then medium heat And we have high heat cook

14
00:00:57,330 --> 00:01:03,330
on high heat cook on low heat cook on medium heat And then we can say how long we should do that.

15
00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:04,240
OK.

16
00:01:04,350 --> 00:01:09,590
But sometimes we don't know how long exactly that will take.

17
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:11,180
We don't know if it's 20 minutes.

18
00:01:11,190 --> 00:01:11,430
Right.

19
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:17,070
So instead of saying how many minutes to cook it describe the condition.

20
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:23,930
Describe what it should look like before you do something else cook until golden brown golden brown

21
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:25,410
that's the color of it.

22
00:01:25,410 --> 00:01:32,070
So once it becomes golden brown then do the next thing add the lettuce or whatever else you need to

23
00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:35,460
do cook it until it's golden brown.

24
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:35,930
OK.

25
00:01:35,940 --> 00:01:44,520
Stir fry the onions and slowly add the sauce now to stir fry as an action is to move the food around

26
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:46,320
in a pan or a walk.

27
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:50,070
As we talked about a walk is generally what we used to cook Chinese food.

28
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:50,560
OK.

29
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:56,960
And then slowly as we're doing this we're adding another thing or adding sauce or adding sauce.

30
00:01:56,970 --> 00:01:59,790
So we're doing this and another action at the same time.

31
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:04,540
So when you need to describe two actions at the same time do it like this.

32
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:06,350
Do this action right.

33
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:13,050
Boil it and then slowly add or whatever you need to say that you need to do at the same time steam it

34
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:16,740
for 15 minutes and let it cool let it cool.

35
00:02:16,830 --> 00:02:18,110
That's pretty straightforward.

36
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:22,110
It's saying two actions in a row you're not doing those two at the same time.

37
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:24,720
First you steam it with a steamer for example.

38
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:27,210
Then you turn off the heat and then you leave it.

39
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:32,580
You don't touch it for 15 minutes then maybe you can eat it or maybe you do the next step.

40
00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:39,770
OK then we have these three phrases which can allow us to basically describe a next action.

41
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:41,910
Next you need to for example.

42
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:48,090
Next you need to stir fry the onions and slowly add the sauce whatever the next action is.

43
00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:51,480
It's a way to sort of move on to the next thing.

44
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:54,660
Once that's done make sure to.

45
00:02:54,720 --> 00:03:02,220
So as a reminder when we're describing a specific step we can say this one once that's done steam it

46
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:06,690
for 15 minutes and let it cool once that's done.

47
00:03:06,690 --> 00:03:13,050
Make sure to pour a little bit of soy sauce on top or whatever it is.

48
00:03:13,070 --> 00:03:13,630
OK.

49
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:21,600
When it's finished now maybe we could talk about a specific step here or the whole thing when it's finished.

50
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:25,440
Serve it in a bowl or when it's finished.

51
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:27,540
Add a little bit of sugar on top.

52
00:03:27,550 --> 00:03:30,000
Or we could say sprinkle.

53
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,800
We have all kinds of little words like this that you can learn separately because there are so many

54
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:42,450
of them sprinkling is basically adding a powder salt or sugar or something like that to the top of something

55
00:03:42,450 --> 00:03:47,960
grains of something or a powder of something to the top to sprinkle with your fingers.

56
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:54,660
We also use for example pinch a pinch is when you grab something with these two fingers a pinch of for

57
00:03:54,660 --> 00:04:01,920
example a pinch of salt a pinch of sugar when it's finished sprinkle a few pinches of salt on top and

58
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:04,800
serve it in a large serving bowl.

59
00:04:05,270 --> 00:04:06,760
OK so that's pretty simple.

60
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:12,420
These are some common phrases certainly not all the phrases that we could possibly talk about or use

61
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:19,170
but some of the common phrases that we will come across when we need to describe the process of cooking

62
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:19,890
a dish.
