1
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:10,770
In the last lesson we talked about meetings we talked about how to give feedback on a proposal and also

2
00:00:10,770 --> 00:00:13,100
how to keep the meeting on track.

3
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:18,440
In this lesson we're going to be talking about food not everything about food.

4
00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:21,090
We're going to focus mostly on cooking.

5
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:26,460
If you don't know how to describe cooking then in this lesson you are going to learn how to talk about

6
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:27,530
cooking food.

7
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:31,890
How to describe cooking and it's actually not as hard as you might think.

8
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:36,660
There are some simple things that we will learn which will be very useful when you want to describe

9
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:38,050
how to make something.

10
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:42,840
But at the beginning of the lesson we're going to talk about cuisine what exactly that means because

11
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:49,230
that's often a word that's misused and and misunderstood then we're going to talk about actions related

12
00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:50,310
to cooking.

13
00:00:50,310 --> 00:00:55,380
Then we're gonna focus on some of vocabulary and phrases useful vocabulary and phrases that we need

14
00:00:55,380 --> 00:00:55,940
to know.

15
00:00:56,070 --> 00:01:04,170
Then we'll get into a recipe will actually go through step by step a recipe for a particular dish.

16
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:06,090
We're actually going to do a Chinese dish.

17
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:13,070
I'm not a cooking expert but it will help us to practice the basics of describing how to cook.

18
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:16,490
So let's get started and talk about cuisine.
