1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:05,670
Let's focus on the actions that we do to prepare food or to cook food.

2
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:13,350
One interesting thing to keep in mind when we're preparing food is that whatever action or verb that

3
00:00:13,350 --> 00:00:17,160
we do to a particular food then changes the name of that thing.

4
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:24,060
So all we do then is use the verb to say what we did to the food or the ingredient.

5
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:28,630
That's the particular thing that's going to be in it like carrots or whatever.

6
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:34,080
And then we add E.D. to that and it becomes an adjective becomes an adjective for that thing.

7
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:35,530
And that's the new name.

8
00:00:35,950 --> 00:00:36,190
OK.

9
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:39,060
So let's start with cutting how we cut things.

10
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:45,450
Well you can just cut things that's a very general word but there are four common words that are used

11
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:49,900
to describe cutting different things there's chop slice dice and cube.

12
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:53,210
What are the differences between these these words.

13
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:53,480
OK.

14
00:00:53,820 --> 00:01:01,980
So chop is generally when we don't really care about the size of whatever it is that we're cutting but

15
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:09,240
it's not usually long and thin it's usually irregular and we're usually just doing this action on maybe

16
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:10,650
a cutting board.

17
00:01:10,660 --> 00:01:10,850
OK.

18
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:17,200
So for example if you're making soup and you need a carrot that's cut into many pieces.

19
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:22,920
We often call that chopped carrot chopped carrot chopped carrot.

20
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:25,800
So PPE E.D. that's the action.

21
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:28,040
We're doing this cutting into many pieces.

22
00:01:28,050 --> 00:01:31,430
Now we have chopped carrot chopped lettuce for example.

23
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:37,020
You could have chopped vegetables of any kind could chop meat whatever it is.

24
00:01:37,050 --> 00:01:43,860
Usually we're not too focused on the exact size and we are not too careful when we're doing it.

25
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:44,620
OK.

26
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:48,360
Slice is for long thin things.

27
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:53,070
Generally speaking you have for example sliced tomato.

28
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:59,820
So if you have a sliced tomato you take a tomato and you cut it into long thin pieces.

29
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:02,100
That is a sliced tomato.

30
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:06,290
So as I mentioned when you do an action then it changes the name.

31
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:11,190
So put sliced tomatoes at the top or on top of the salad.

32
00:02:11,210 --> 00:02:11,520
OK.

33
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:14,340
So that becomes E.D. sliced.

34
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:17,060
Notice the pronunciation is not done.

35
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:20,750
This one is chopped because it's unvoiced.

36
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:24,720
This one is sliced because this is unvoiced.

37
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:25,670
You don't use your voice.

38
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:30,370
So we say we could say sliced cucumbers we could say sliced bread.

39
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:37,410
We could say sliced ham whatever we need to say but generally we're focusing on longer thinner things

40
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:41,430
rather than cutting things up in an irregular shape which would be chopping.

41
00:02:41,450 --> 00:02:42,720
OK dice.

42
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:48,710
Well dicing is very similar to chopping something except the pieces will be smaller.

43
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:50,190
We one very small pieces.

44
00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:56,930
So if we do that to an onion then instead of having a chopped onion maybe the sizes are this big.

45
00:02:56,940 --> 00:03:05,970
Now we're going to have diced onion so a chopped onion like that a sliced onion circular pieces generally.

46
00:03:05,970 --> 00:03:08,250
All right thin.

47
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:09,960
And then a diced onion.

48
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:14,880
Tiny little pieces of onion that we're going to put into a dish for example.

49
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:15,290
OK.

50
00:03:15,390 --> 00:03:17,340
Diced onion again.

51
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:24,780
Psst psst chopped sliced diced the pronunciation of D for all three of these is.

52
00:03:25,350 --> 00:03:27,390
But this one will be different.

53
00:03:27,390 --> 00:03:27,950
OK.

54
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:33,130
Now when you cube something this is a verb cube to cube cube is also a noun.

55
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:35,040
You cut it into the shape of a cube.

56
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:39,230
So for example cubed beef or cubed potato.

57
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:40,940
Notice I'm saying cube.

58
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:44,520
Why am I saying Cube did not cubed like the others.

59
00:03:44,610 --> 00:03:53,100
I said for the others let's because this book uses the voice but if we have a voiced sound then it's

60
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:55,240
going to be pronounced as.

61
00:03:55,440 --> 00:04:03,480
So cubed potato and cube beef whatever it is for example for a soup that we're making is the shape generally

62
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:08,610
doesn't have to be exactly of a cube which is a 3D 3D square.

63
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:14,670
So we're maybe a little bit more focused on what the shape is and we care maybe more than if we're chopping

64
00:04:14,670 --> 00:04:15,540
something.

65
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:15,800
OK.

66
00:04:15,810 --> 00:04:17,250
So I hope that's pretty simple.

67
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:20,990
Chopped sliced diced cubed all cutting actions.

68
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:27,870
And every time you finish doing it then it is that thing E.D. and then the original ingredient that

69
00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:35,400
you used cubed beef chopped onion sliced tomato diced cucumber OK.

70
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:36,710
That's pretty simple.

71
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:39,630
Now here are some other actions that follow the same rule.

72
00:04:39,630 --> 00:04:45,110
We have mixed peeled and washed six unvoiced.

73
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:51,830
So we set mixed peel or voiced so we say peeled and wash.

74
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:55,700
Sheesh unvoiced so we say washed.

75
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:56,280
OK.

76
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,580
So for example we could say mixed greens.

77
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:06,120
That means the vegetables that we're using are all green maybe lettuce maybe spinach for example lettuce

78
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:07,300
spinach.

79
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:07,760
OK.

80
00:05:07,770 --> 00:05:08,690
We have those together.

81
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:10,750
That would be mixed greens.

82
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:11,190
OK.

83
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:15,110
And we have peel which means we cut the skin off of something OK.

84
00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:20,910
We wouldn't use that for example for a banana although the thing on the outside of a banana is a banana

85
00:05:20,910 --> 00:05:21,450
peel.

86
00:05:21,450 --> 00:05:23,720
We usually don't say peeled bananas.

87
00:05:23,730 --> 00:05:25,770
I guess you can but it's not so common.

88
00:05:25,770 --> 00:05:32,850
Usually it's when we cut off with a knife the outside or the skin of something for example peeled apples

89
00:05:33,090 --> 00:05:37,720
or we might say peeled potatoes peeled potatoes.

90
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:38,140
OK.

91
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:42,200
If you have peeled potatoes then you don't have to say peel the potatoes.

92
00:05:42,210 --> 00:05:48,120
You could say add peeled potatoes to whatever thing you're making then you don't need to say you need

93
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:53,540
to peel the potatoes because in order to get peeled potatoes you first have to peel them.

94
00:05:53,550 --> 00:05:54,960
Otherwise they're not peeled.

95
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:55,140
Right.

96
00:05:55,140 --> 00:06:01,530
So that can be actually a useful little tool for making a description of what you're cooking easier

97
00:06:01,530 --> 00:06:02,380
and simpler.

98
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,160
You don't have to say things twice.

99
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,900
Obviously washed whatever it is you might wash.

100
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:12,470
Hopefully you wash most things like fruit and vegetables before you before you actually eat them.

101
00:06:12,510 --> 00:06:17,100
For example you could say washed lettuce or whatever it is whatever it is.

102
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:17,600
OK.

103
00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:20,030
So I hope that's pretty straight forward.

104
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:26,400
Now let's get into the ways that we cook things and these are the common ones and it follows the same

105
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:26,920
rule.

106
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:33,550
If you do these actions then that thing then becomes that with E.D. after it as the adjective.

107
00:06:33,550 --> 00:06:40,410
So baked potatoes baked potatoes fried potatoes stir fried potatoes.

108
00:06:40,410 --> 00:06:40,610
Yeah.

109
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:44,040
Maybe if we're making Chinese food boiled potatoes.

110
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:48,430
Yeah sure steamed potatoes maybe.

111
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:53,400
I don't know any steamed potatoes but I guess it's possible grilled potatoes.

112
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:56,520
Why don't we just do a very quick example for each of these.

113
00:06:56,550 --> 00:06:58,930
So I will bake a potato.

114
00:06:58,950 --> 00:07:04,230
Now I have baked potatoes and I've done that in an oven.

115
00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:06,600
I will fry mushrooms.

116
00:07:06,630 --> 00:07:07,530
Why not.

117
00:07:07,530 --> 00:07:11,980
Now I have fried mushrooms and then I will fry them in a pan.

118
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:12,580
OK.

119
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:18,950
Now stir fry is usually where you have constant motion but it's kind of the same thing.

120
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:24,510
Deep frying is when you put it deep in oil stir frying is often connected with Chinese cuisine.

121
00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:33,090
So I could have for example I could have stir fried stir fried tomato and eggs and I might do that in

122
00:07:33,090 --> 00:07:38,600
a walk to special sort of pan which is bigger it's more bowl shaped like boil.

123
00:07:38,650 --> 00:07:44,950
They boiled and we've boiled while these boiled cabbage boring.

124
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,860
And we'll do that in a pot.

125
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:51,510
Steam has steamed it could have steamed dumplings.

126
00:07:51,510 --> 00:07:58,380
That's Chinese cuisine and we'll steamed that in a steamer but you could also steam it in a pan I suppose

127
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:06,310
and then grill say grilled chicken and we would grill it on a hot grill.

128
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:06,550
OK.

129
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:07,760
So I hope that's pretty easy.

130
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:08,600
Hope that simple.

131
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:14,150
Let's now go on and talk about some common cooking phrases that we can use which are related to what

132
00:08:14,150 --> 00:08:15,700
we were just describing.
