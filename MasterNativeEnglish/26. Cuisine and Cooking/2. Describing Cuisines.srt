1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:06,830
When we discuss food and which kinds of food we like we often need to use the word cuisine.

2
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:08,910
What exactly does it mean.

3
00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:10,560
Kind of easy to misunderstand.

4
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:21,400
Well cuisine generally is a type of food that is specific to or connected to a particular place or culture.

5
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:24,310
Now it could be a country but it doesn't have to be a country.

6
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:30,450
For example you could have Japanese cuisine but then there might be a particular city that's famous

7
00:00:30,450 --> 00:00:31,140
for food.

8
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:38,610
You might have for example New Orleans cuisine which is a famous type of cuisine in America or you could

9
00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:41,480
have for example a province name like in China.

10
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:43,480
You have Sichuan cuisine.

11
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:46,290
So that's a particular area in China.

12
00:00:46,290 --> 00:00:49,640
Then for each area in China you have different cuisines.

13
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:55,300
So usually it's related to a place but not necessarily it could be just cultural.

14
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:59,580
Any way we can say it's a type of food a cuisine is a type of food.

15
00:00:59,580 --> 00:01:06,540
So often when you hear people say what cuisines Do you like or what is your favorite cuisine you can

16
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:13,380
just say the type of food you like Oh I like French cuisine I like Japanese cuisine I like Indian cuisine

17
00:01:13,410 --> 00:01:16,150
I like Italian cuisine whatever you want to say.

18
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:18,300
Now sometimes those things are not clear.

19
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:24,560
For example if you say I like American cuisine you might have to describe what exactly you mean by that

20
00:01:24,570 --> 00:01:33,660
because that's less clearly defined than perhaps other countries such as French cuisine and Italian

21
00:01:33,870 --> 00:01:35,610
cuisine or Indian cuisine.

22
00:01:35,610 --> 00:01:41,970
We often use subjective adjectives and we're talking about the feeling we have about particular cuisines

23
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:49,740
or the feeling that we have about maybe the taste of a particular food and it could be the overall feeling

24
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:53,100
or it could be something more specific about the taste.

25
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:54,410
Let me explain what I mean.

26
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:56,210
So take Indian food.

27
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:57,500
I like Indian food.

28
00:01:57,510 --> 00:01:59,250
How would you describe Indian food.

29
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:03,150
Well again it's quite it's quite subjective in some way.

30
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:10,620
I would describe Indian food as a bit heavy and that's because after I eat Indian food I feel a bit

31
00:02:10,890 --> 00:02:11,760
a bit heavy.

32
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:14,070
So I feel Indian food is a bit heavy.

33
00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:15,410
That's kind of subjective.

34
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:20,570
But generally speaking it's more spicy than other cuisines.

35
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:27,630
Many other cuisines so it's it's also spicy and that's more related to the particular taste of the food.

36
00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:31,530
It's got a lot of different spices in it and it's very hot when you eat it.

37
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:32,900
Some of it is OK.

38
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:34,460
So it's a bit heavy.

39
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:36,870
That's my feeling and it's spicy.

40
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:37,770
How about German food.

41
00:02:37,830 --> 00:02:42,110
Well German food generally people describe as heavy again.

42
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:47,370
That's because the feeling of the food people eat it generally they feel it's quite heavy compared to

43
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:53,820
other types of food like for example Japanese food which people often describe as very light so heavy

44
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:55,950
and light aren't exactly tastes.

45
00:02:55,950 --> 00:02:58,470
Their overall feelings.

46
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:01,050
What about the taste of Japanese food.

47
00:03:01,050 --> 00:03:04,440
Well it doesn't have a very strong taste typically.

48
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:10,740
For example like Indian food which might be very spicy which uses a lot of spices Japanese food is often

49
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:13,060
very simple and you could say it's very simple.

50
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:15,040
You could also say it's very mild.

51
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:16,620
M I L D mild.

52
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:22,950
If something doesn't have a particularly strong taste it's often described as mild mild is a word that

53
00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:29,580
can also be used to describe whether you live in a place that doesn't have extremely hot weather in

54
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:32,660
the summer and not extremely cold weather in the winter.

55
00:03:32,730 --> 00:03:39,040
Then maybe you live in a mild climate so a mild climate is sort of not too strong not that weak kind

56
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:39,870
of in the middle.

57
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:45,930
Gentle a bit gentle and you could go on with other adjectives that you feel are related to particular

58
00:03:45,930 --> 00:03:54,420
cuisines Sichuan food from China is famous for being very spicy and very oily it's very oily and very

59
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:55,290
spicy.

60
00:03:55,290 --> 00:04:01,140
You could say German food as I mentioned is very heavy but you might also say that it can be a bit bland.

61
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:07,380
That means no offense to German food can be a little bit boring it's not very exciting like for example

62
00:04:08,110 --> 00:04:12,530
like for example Indian food or maybe Thai food it's kind of an exciting cuisine.

63
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:14,210
Both of those are a bit exciting.

64
00:04:14,310 --> 00:04:19,140
They are they can be very spicy or Mexican food Mexican cuisine.

65
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:24,840
So a lot of these are words that you choose based on your feeling but there are general words common

66
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:29,750
words that are associated associated to each type of food.

67
00:04:29,790 --> 00:04:35,880
For example German food being heavy and Sichuan food being for example spicy and oily.

68
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:44,580
OK so when you're talking about cuisine use subjective adjectives and focus on the type of food whatever

69
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:45,670
you want to say about it.
