1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:04,200
Now we know pretty much everything we need to know to actually get into the recipe.

2
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:11,190
Let's first talk about the ingredients we need to make stir fried tomato and eggs a classic Chinese

3
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:16,980
dish which actually I really enjoy making something I can actually make to make stir fried tomato and

4
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:23,670
eggs you will need three eggs or more if you prefer to chopped and peeled tomatoes some people slice

5
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:33,540
them some people cut them into wedges sesame oil salt sugar olive oil and scallions you can add diced

6
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:34,980
Ginger if you like.

7
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,060
So that's an option.

8
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:37,350
It's an optional thing.

9
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:40,910
Also you'll need steamed rice on the side.

10
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:46,950
OK so we're not going to actually add that to the walk to the pan but we will need it when we actually

11
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:47,340
eat it.

12
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:49,590
So I have steamed rice on the side.

13
00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:51,200
So these are the ingredients.

14
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:54,540
This is what we need to actually prepare our dish.

15
00:00:54,540 --> 00:00:56,760
Now let's get into the recipe itself.

16
00:00:56,790 --> 00:01:02,010
So we're going to add two tablespoons of olive oil into a pre heated walk.

17
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:06,410
Remember that's a kind of pan and wait for the oil to heat up next.

18
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:11,550
Add diced scallions to kind of it's like an onion.

19
00:01:11,550 --> 00:01:19,860
And when you smell the aroma of the scallions Beat the eggs Beat the eggs and pour them into the pan.

20
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:24,830
Once they are almost fully cooked pour them back into the mixing bowl.

21
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:30,480
So that's really step one after we take the eggs and we pour them into the mixing bowl again.

22
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:32,760
Now the walk is probably cool.

23
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:38,760
So we need to reheated so reheat the pan and add another tablespoon of olive oil.

24
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:45,210
If you're using Ginger if you're using Ginger add that then immediately add the tomatoes and cook them

25
00:01:45,210 --> 00:01:48,930
until they start turning golden brown.

26
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:49,420
OK.

27
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:52,000
So that's the condition we're not going to use time.

28
00:01:52,050 --> 00:01:57,720
We're going to use a description instead of saying this many minutes because maybe you're cooking on

29
00:01:57,720 --> 00:02:05,700
a higher or lower temperature until they start turning golden brown then put in the sesame oil a tablespoon

30
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:06,380
of sugar.

31
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:12,970
That's a measurement of sugar a tablespoon of sugar and a few pinches of salt to taste.

32
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:18,390
If you add something to taste that means basically you add it until it's enough for you.

33
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:20,190
Some people like saltier food.

34
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:22,220
Some people like food that's less salty.

35
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:27,980
So add it according to what you like add a few pinches of salt to taste.

36
00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:32,780
Finally add the eggs into the walk and stir fry for another two minutes.

37
00:02:32,770 --> 00:02:38,580
So now we want to use time because we want to make sure we don't overcook the tomatoes or overcooked

38
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:39,060
the eggs.

39
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:41,640
We're going to cook only for two minutes more.

40
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:44,550
Stir fry for another two minutes.

41
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:44,800
OK.

42
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:45,930
And then it's done.

43
00:02:46,050 --> 00:02:49,320
Basically we could say add the eggs back into the walk.

44
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:57,120
You could say back because they've been in before and you could say stir fry for two minutes or until

45
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:00,480
and then you could make a description if you want to do that.

46
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:03,630
That way you want to make sure it's not overcooked.

47
00:03:03,630 --> 00:03:09,180
So for example if you say or until the tomatoes start getting very soft.

48
00:03:09,210 --> 00:03:14,340
So in other words if they start getting very soft before two minutes then take everything out.

49
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:20,520
Sometimes having two instructions a time or a description can make sure something that you don't want

50
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:22,320
to happen doesn't happen.

51
00:03:22,650 --> 00:03:27,840
Finally turn off the heat and let it cool for five minutes.

52
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:30,590
Serve over steamed white rice.

53
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:30,950
OK.

54
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:34,020
So just turn it off that means turn off the burner.

55
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:37,160
We can sometimes call that a burner and just leave it there.

56
00:03:37,170 --> 00:03:38,100
Don't touch it.

57
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:45,450
Then after five minutes can put it on top of steamed rice when we serve something over something then

58
00:03:45,450 --> 00:03:46,380
we don't mix it in.

59
00:03:46,380 --> 00:03:48,450
You don't want to mix it into the rice.

60
00:03:48,450 --> 00:03:49,680
Here's the white rice.

61
00:03:49,770 --> 00:03:52,120
Here's the tomato and egg on top of it.

62
00:03:52,230 --> 00:03:56,940
And then people can sort of mix it as they're eating it if they want to or not.

63
00:03:56,970 --> 00:04:03,110
That's the difference between mixing things in and serving over hopefully at the end of this lesson

64
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:09,030
you feel more comfortable talking about food and how to prepare it in English at the beginning we talked

65
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:12,310
about cuisine and how we can describe our feelings about cuisine.

66
00:04:12,390 --> 00:04:18,330
Some common cooking actions and some useful phrases and then we actually looked at a real recipe including

67
00:04:18,330 --> 00:04:22,070
the ingredients that we need for that recipe.

68
00:04:22,110 --> 00:04:28,740
Now to practice this what I'd like you to do is write down a recipe describe a recipe in detail.

69
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:34,980
Talk about the ingredients and all of the actions the amounts and then give it to a friend and see if

70
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:41,400
it comes out OK Have them make it and then maybe go over to their house and see if your description

71
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:44,230
of the dish actually worked.

72
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:46,170
Remember to do it only in English.

73
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:52,220
That's a real test of how well you're able to describe a particular food that you know how to cook.

74
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:55,200
So good luck with that and I will see you in the next lesson.
