1
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:09,590
In the last lesson we talked about how to tell a story and we talked about progress.

2
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:18,660
Connecting details in time in the past with our emotions and also what we were doing at that time in

3
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:20,690
a linear way linear.

4
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:28,720
By the way means in order this and this and then this and then this linear linear linear means in order.

5
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:35,730
OK well we're going to do something that's also in order in this lesson we're going to be talking about

6
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:38,920
how we order food in order.

7
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,030
That means you do this and then you do this.

8
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:43,000
It's linear.

9
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:43,570
OK.

10
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:50,340
We're going to talk about when you go to a restaurant how you ask for what you want how you explain

11
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:51,420
what you want.

12
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:57,380
And we're also going to talk about some of the other kinds of things you may need to say in the restaurant.

13
00:00:57,390 --> 00:01:03,430
Some of the other things that may happen in the restaurant when you want to get your food.

14
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:06,810
That's what we're going to do in this lesson.

15
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:12,300
Now we're going to talk first about a couple of phrases that are important that you need to know when

16
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:19,050
you're going to ask for things and then we're going to actually look at how to talk with a waiter.

17
00:01:19,050 --> 00:01:22,590
Some things you may need to say before you actually order your food.

18
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:26,550
Then we'll look at an example of an order how you would say what you want.

19
00:01:26,550 --> 00:01:32,310
We'll look at a similar to real life example and then we'll talk about payment.

20
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:39,210
We'll talk a bit about how to ask for the check which is very simple and then we'll have a practice

21
00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:39,840
as well.

22
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:40,640
So let's get started.
