1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:05,820
So now we've talked about in our restaurant situation how to order food.

2
00:00:05,820 --> 00:00:15,330
We've talked about how to make a reservation how to tell the host or hostess how many people are going

3
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:23,070
to sit at your table and how to ask for a menu how to get a wine list how to do all that stuff before

4
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:26,660
you order including getting a suggestion.

5
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:29,410
Talked about a couple of important words we need to know.

6
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:35,400
And now we need to actually go through an order it's actually pretty simple.

7
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:41,220
When we went through the phrases at the beginning of the class we we talked about a few things that

8
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:45,100
you can use to request something and we'll see those.

9
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:46,440
In this example.

10
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:48,340
So let's go through this example.

11
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:53,670
This is me ordering a pizza from a waitress.

12
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:58,950
OK I guess I'll have a small garden pizza without onions.

13
00:00:58,950 --> 00:01:00,690
THAT MEANS THERE'S THIS PIZZA.

14
00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:02,580
IT'S CALLED THE GARDEN pizza.

15
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:08,580
And it has onions but I don't want the onions all the small garden Pizza the other sizes are probably

16
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:12,570
medium and large of a small garden pizza without onions.

17
00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:14,990
And I'd like extra cheese.

18
00:01:14,990 --> 00:01:16,050
I'd like extra cheese.

19
00:01:16,050 --> 00:01:17,230
I'd like.

20
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:17,770
Remember.

21
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:19,890
I'd like add cheese please.

22
00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:21,200
More cheese.

23
00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:22,800
There's already cheese I want more.

24
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:24,280
Give me more cheese OK.

25
00:01:24,690 --> 00:01:31,730
Oh could you also please add sun dried tomatoes to half sun dried tomatoes.

26
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:34,590
Are there sun dried tomatoes.

27
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:36,270
There tomatoes that sit in the sun.

28
00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:37,140
They're delicious.

29
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:40,380
If you haven't had those on pizza you've got to try it.

30
00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:42,520
You don't get anything else from this course.

31
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:47,160
Hopefully the recommendation about sun dried tomatoes will be something you try.

32
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:50,300
I'd like to add sun dried tomatoes 2 1/2.

33
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:50,530
OK.

34
00:01:50,550 --> 00:01:54,080
So I only want it on this part this part not the whole thing.

35
00:01:54,120 --> 00:02:00,250
And then I'll have I'll have a side salad as well a side salad.

36
00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:01,500
That's a smaller salad.

37
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:05,020
If it's just a salad maybe that's my whole meal.

38
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:08,580
That's my main food right my main course side.

39
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:09,990
So it comes with the pizza.

40
00:02:10,290 --> 00:02:11,030
OK.

41
00:02:11,130 --> 00:02:14,910
Then the waitress says what kind of dressing on the salad.

42
00:02:14,910 --> 00:02:16,230
What kind of dressing on the salad.

43
00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:19,320
Remember I mentioned dressing comes with a salad.

44
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:20,820
It's on a salad.

45
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:23,270
I'll have thousand island Thousand Island.

46
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:26,100
And I also don't want onions on my salad.

47
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:30,560
So usually a salad will come with red onions maybe I don't want onions.

48
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:36,780
In fact I actually like onions and I would never order extra cheese and I would never order a Thousand

49
00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:37,200
Island.

50
00:02:37,230 --> 00:02:38,700
I just made this example.

51
00:02:38,850 --> 00:02:43,160
And when I made this example I was I became someone else.

52
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:45,120
OK I'll have Thousand Island.

53
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:45,990
It's orange.

54
00:02:45,990 --> 00:02:47,740
Thousand Island is orange.

55
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:48,570
It's a kind of dressing.

56
00:02:48,570 --> 00:02:49,580
Very popular.

57
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:50,450
I have Thousand Island.

58
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:53,280
And I also don't want onions on my salad.

59
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,520
Sure no problem.

60
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:57,100
That's a way to recognize what I said.

61
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:59,550
That lets me know that she heard what I said.

62
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:03,960
She's writing it down on her little book tour no problem.

63
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:04,920
Anything else.

64
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:10,350
Whenever you want to know if somebody wants more stuff after they've already told you two or three or

65
00:03:10,350 --> 00:03:11,820
four or five things.

66
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:16,300
The best phrase you can use is anything else.

67
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:17,580
Can I have a Coca-Cola.

68
00:03:17,610 --> 00:03:18,690
Anything else.

69
00:03:18,690 --> 00:03:19,830
Can I have some chocolate.

70
00:03:19,830 --> 00:03:20,310
Sure.

71
00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:21,210
Anything else.

72
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,020
I have a coffee.

73
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:22,620
OK.

74
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:25,820
Anything else you can say it Forever Forever.

75
00:03:25,970 --> 00:03:28,020
It's a pretty polite phrase as well.

76
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:32,670
It's just a way to say I'm ready if you want to tell me you want more stuff.

77
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:33,840
OK.

78
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:34,890
Sure no problem.

79
00:03:34,890 --> 00:03:36,240
Anything else.

80
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:41,910
Will that be all means the same thing but it's a little bit more formal.

81
00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:42,730
Will that be all.

82
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:45,600
It's kind of expecting me to say Yes I'm finished.

83
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:48,420
Anything else is kind of open like I have no idea.

84
00:03:48,450 --> 00:03:49,800
Maybe you do want more.

85
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:50,440
Right.

86
00:03:50,490 --> 00:03:53,990
So they're kind of the same in this situation but they feel different.

87
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,260
Will that be all.

88
00:03:55,380 --> 00:03:57,240
Expects me to be finished.

89
00:03:57,240 --> 00:04:03,280
Anything else makes me feel like well when I'll also have the catch of the day Catch of the day.

90
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:04,850
Fish and pizza together.

91
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:05,820
That's very strange.

92
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:06,750
OK.

93
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:08,490
That's all for now.

94
00:04:08,490 --> 00:04:14,300
Again we use this to let the waiter or waitress know that we might order something else later.

95
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:18,290
In this case probably dessert we might order dessert later.

96
00:04:18,330 --> 00:04:19,300
So that's it.

97
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:24,570
That's how you order we used some of the phrases we learned at the beginning of class as well as a few

98
00:04:24,570 --> 00:04:25,950
of the words we went over.

99
00:04:25,950 --> 00:04:31,320
And it's pretty simple but if you do it enough times you'll get the feeling for how many different ways

100
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:34,320
you can put these phrases together.

101
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:39,480
And I want to show you at least one so that you can you know you can really kind of feel it.

102
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:42,080
I think that's an important part of learning a language.

103
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:45,060
It's not only about learning grammar and rules and words.

104
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:51,720
You also have to kind of feel it because language especially using spoken language is very cultural.

105
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:53,460
It's really related to the culture.

106
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:57,120
The culture happens sort of within situations at a restaurant.

107
00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:02,400
So you've got to try to figure feel how these are used naturally.

108
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:07,140
I'm trying to get these across but I hope you can actually try to use them.

109
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:13,580
So go to go to a restaurant order something in English and try them out try it out play with it.
