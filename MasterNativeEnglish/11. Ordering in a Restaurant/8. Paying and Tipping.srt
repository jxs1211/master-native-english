1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:01,230
So you've ordered.

2
00:00:01,230 --> 00:00:03,780
You've gone through all that stuff you've eaten your food.

3
00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:05,190
It's delicious.

4
00:00:05,210 --> 00:00:06,830
Right it's been a great meal.

5
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:08,160
Now you need to pay.

6
00:00:08,190 --> 00:00:10,130
Why do they make you pay at the end.

7
00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:13,640
They should make you pay at the beginning when you're excited to eat right.

8
00:00:13,660 --> 00:00:14,820
You've you've eaten it all.

9
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:17,300
Now you need to pay at the end OK.

10
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:21,920
You see a waitress over there to get your waiter or waitresses attention.

11
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:24,690
Watch them moving around the restaurant.

12
00:00:24,770 --> 00:00:29,500
And when you see them looking in your direction can do this.

13
00:00:29,610 --> 00:00:36,170
Just like that whether you want something or if you're ready to pay to ask for the check.

14
00:00:36,250 --> 00:00:37,330
Do this.

15
00:00:37,330 --> 00:00:42,290
And when they return that when they recognize you when they acknowledge you they look at you.

16
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:46,190
You go like this can mouth

17
00:00:50,230 --> 00:00:53,380
that they will bring over the check or the Bill to you.

18
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:55,900
They'll go because they're far away.

19
00:00:55,900 --> 00:00:56,170
Right.

20
00:00:56,200 --> 00:01:00,070
You don't want to shout like that across the restaurant.

21
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:06,840
You want to do it in a quiet way because usually the restaurant will have a nice a nice quiet quiet

22
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:09,170
quiet quiet atmosphere.

23
00:01:09,170 --> 00:01:09,990
Right.

24
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,810
Very important right.

25
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:13,140
OK.

26
00:01:13,150 --> 00:01:14,510
So check please.

27
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:21,520
Is the most common I think and this hand gesture goes with it catching the eye of your waiter or waitress.

28
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:25,500
We also say if they're right here could we get the check.

29
00:01:25,510 --> 00:01:26,500
Could we get the check.

30
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:27,610
Could I get the check.

31
00:01:27,610 --> 00:01:28,660
We'll have the bill.

32
00:01:28,660 --> 00:01:29,650
We'll have the bill.

33
00:01:29,650 --> 00:01:31,030
I'll have the bill.

34
00:01:31,180 --> 00:01:32,280
I'm ready for the bill.

35
00:01:32,290 --> 00:01:33,490
Ready for the check.

36
00:01:33,490 --> 00:01:34,110
Excuse me.

37
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:36,360
Yes I'm ready for the check.

38
00:01:36,370 --> 00:01:37,360
I'm ready for the bill.

39
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:38,710
I think we're ready for the bill.

40
00:01:38,710 --> 00:01:40,540
Sometimes we can add that too.

41
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:44,590
There are lots of different ways to say it but these are these are the basic ones.

42
00:01:44,650 --> 00:01:45,160
OK.

43
00:01:45,190 --> 00:01:47,970
And then she says Sure I'll be right back with that.

44
00:01:47,980 --> 00:01:56,290
So she brings it now maybe maybe I've invited my friend out and I really want to treat my friend.

45
00:01:56,350 --> 00:02:01,930
I really want to treat my friend because I haven't seen him or her in a while so I'd say I'll get it

46
00:02:02,290 --> 00:02:06,720
I'll get it or it's on me in American culture saying it's on me.

47
00:02:06,850 --> 00:02:11,710
If you don't say something like that it will be assumed that you will pay for yours and I will pay for

48
00:02:11,710 --> 00:02:12,000
mine.

49
00:02:12,010 --> 00:02:20,260
Probably we will split the bill so usually we'll say Shall we split it shall we split it right.

50
00:02:20,290 --> 00:02:25,430
Don't assume that I will pay for you and I'm not going to assume that you're going to pay for me.

51
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:31,420
In fact in American culture it's very common for people to split the bill but we usually still will

52
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:36,440
say this shall we split it shall we split it if I want to treat you.

53
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:38,190
I can say I'll get it.

54
00:02:38,290 --> 00:02:46,630
It's on me or sometimes just MY TREAT MY TREAT MY TREAT.

55
00:02:46,630 --> 00:02:47,680
Are you sure.

56
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:48,550
Are you sure.

57
00:02:48,550 --> 00:02:50,830
That's very nice of you I'm sure.

58
00:02:50,830 --> 00:02:52,440
I'm sure it's my treat.

59
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:53,250
That's my treat.

60
00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:54,460
Thank you so much.

61
00:02:54,460 --> 00:02:55,740
I'll get the next one.

62
00:02:56,050 --> 00:03:02,300
I'll get the next one so you don't have to treat people.

63
00:03:02,370 --> 00:03:03,760
You can definitely split it.

64
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:06,440
You might have heard the phrase going Dutch.

65
00:03:06,510 --> 00:03:08,430
Actually it's not that common.

66
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:12,480
Now this is an American thing but I said we would come back to tipping.

67
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:19,530
We have to talk about that for waiters and waitresses and often hosts and hostesses and also bartenders

68
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:22,070
people who work in the bar.

69
00:03:22,350 --> 00:03:27,420
Their salary might be very low and they depend on tips.

70
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:31,370
It's a very important part of a lot of services especially in America.

71
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:33,760
It's very important for whatever reason.

72
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:38,190
OK so if you go to a nice restaurant you've got a tip.

73
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:39,130
How do you leave the tip.

74
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:41,190
You can leave the tip usually in the check.

75
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:47,670
They'll give you a receipt after they swipe your card they'll swipe your card and then they'll bring

76
00:03:47,670 --> 00:03:49,820
you the receipt.

77
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:50,160
Right.

78
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:52,850
With the amount on it and a line under it.

79
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:56,850
So this may be you will say thirty four dollars.

80
00:03:56,890 --> 00:03:57,850
Right.

81
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:00,870
And then you would maybe tip let's say you want a tip.

82
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:01,440
I don't know.

83
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:04,740
Seven dollars going to tip seven dollars.

84
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:05,020
OK.

85
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:07,510
So now you're going to pay 41.

86
00:04:07,710 --> 00:04:14,700
So there's a blank space and the blank space you write seven and then you add it up and write the total

87
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:21,270
and then you sign your name at the bottom and you leave that in the restaurant it's called the merchant

88
00:04:21,270 --> 00:04:25,700
copy the signed one with the tip and the final amount.

89
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:26,850
It's called the merchant copy.

90
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:33,050
You leave that at the restaurant and you take the customer copy the customer copy.

91
00:04:33,050 --> 00:04:33,740
OK.

92
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:40,970
So there are two copies of the receipt after they swipe your card leave the merchant copy.

93
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:42,350
Take the customer copy.

94
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:47,340
You don't have to fill in the customer copy because it's yours but you can if you want to.

95
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:48,990
So how much is polite to tip.

96
00:04:48,990 --> 00:04:54,830
Well I have here between 10 and 20 10 is considered pretty low for most restaurants.

97
00:04:54,930 --> 00:04:58,830
It's usually 15 to 20 20 is kind of the standard.

98
00:04:58,830 --> 00:05:00,950
If you tip 15 it's okay.

99
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:03,950
It's kind of considered getting a little low but it's OK.

100
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:10,470
So if they did an okay job as your waiter or a waitress then 15 10 percent if they really didn't do

101
00:05:10,470 --> 00:05:12,630
very well maybe they weren't very polite.

102
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:12,890
OK.

103
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:16,440
So you can tip 10 percent maybe but that's not as common.

104
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:22,200
Only if they did a terrible job and maybe they called you bad bad names or something.

105
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:23,330
Can you tip nothing.

106
00:05:23,370 --> 00:05:30,700
I've only not tipped maybe two times in my entire life because I had a terrible terrible experience.

107
00:05:31,050 --> 00:05:34,290
And you want to talk to the manager after that happens.

108
00:05:34,290 --> 00:05:35,860
Listen I need to talk to you.

109
00:05:36,030 --> 00:05:36,900
The waiter.

110
00:05:36,990 --> 00:05:40,560
She didn't come to our table for 30 minutes.

111
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:45,050
Our food came and it was cold and she didn't mention it.

112
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:45,360
All right.

113
00:05:45,390 --> 00:05:48,510
So we had a you know it's a terrible experience.

114
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:51,510
Then maybe you could tip to zero but that's pretty rare.
