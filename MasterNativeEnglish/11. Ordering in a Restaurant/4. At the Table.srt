1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:08,760
So we sit down at the table and probably the hostess will give us some menus if not maybe our waiter

2
00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:16,320
or our waitress will come over and introduce themselves and they'll say I'll be I'll be your waitress

3
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:20,760
your waitress this evening I'll be your waitress this evening.

4
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:26,970
And then she'll probably or he will probably if it's a waiter give you a menu or some menus.

5
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:33,800
If for some reason they don't get menus you could say you could say could we look at some menus please.

6
00:00:33,810 --> 00:00:41,790
Could we look at some menus please.

7
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:47,070
No I think you probably know what a menu is but a menu is the book that you look at which has all the

8
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:47,700
food.

9
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:55,950
There are a lot of vocabulary words related to a menu entrees desserts appetizers all of these are very

10
00:00:55,950 --> 00:01:01,440
common words but really I want to make sure you're comfortable with how to interact in this situation

11
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:04,380
the words themselves are pretty easy to learn.

12
00:01:04,380 --> 00:01:05,910
Could we have some menus please.

13
00:01:05,910 --> 00:01:09,470
Or she gives us the menus and she says can I.

14
00:01:09,470 --> 00:01:11,360
And this is a very common way to say it.

15
00:01:11,370 --> 00:01:13,450
It's almost always exactly the same.

16
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:22,950
Can I start you off with anything to drink.

17
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:24,870
Can I start you off with anything to drink.

18
00:01:24,870 --> 00:01:26,030
It always starts with a drink.

19
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:26,400
Right.

20
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:32,770
So maybe we just want water and if we do we'll just say that just water for me.

21
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:40,440
Now you you might not want to order for the other person you are with so you could just say for me just

22
00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:42,630
just water for me.

23
00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:43,520
Thanks.

24
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:49,980
Now I can say just water instead of I'd like to have a glass of water here because I'm directly responding

25
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:52,930
to the question Can I get you something to drink.

26
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:55,400
If someone says Can I get you something to drink.

27
00:01:55,410 --> 00:02:03,690
And I say I would like a glass of water that's fine but because I'm responding directly if I say just

28
00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:07,980
water we'll just have water that's also OK.

29
00:02:08,010 --> 00:02:13,290
So this is a common way to respond to this sort of question.

30
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:20,530
And if we want to add something we could say for now thanks just water for now things.

31
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:25,710
What that means is right now I want to drink water as I'm maybe looking at the menu.

32
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:30,990
And then once I've decided what food I'm going to get what food I'm going to order maybe what dishes

33
00:02:30,990 --> 00:02:38,820
I want then I can maybe order something else to drink maybe a Coca-Cola some sort of soda or perhaps

34
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:42,000
some wine whatever else I might want.

35
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:47,970
So for now suggests that I probably I will get something else but it doesn't mean I have to.

36
00:02:47,990 --> 00:02:50,610
But I probably will get something else to drink.

37
00:02:50,610 --> 00:03:04,210
So if I do want something else I'll say Can I Can I get a Coke please OK and then you can add and with

38
00:03:04,210 --> 00:03:08,890
no ice with no ice or extra ice whatever.

39
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:09,400
OK.

40
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:12,670
She says OK I'll be right back with those.

41
00:03:12,670 --> 00:03:14,190
I'll be right back with your drink.

42
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:15,020
OK.

43
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:20,290
Maybe though you want alcohol you'd like to drink some alcohol and you're not sure what alcohol they

44
00:03:20,290 --> 00:03:21,370
have.

45
00:03:21,370 --> 00:03:26,320
So you might say something like could we could we.

46
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:28,550
Same sentence as we did with the menus.

47
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:33,280
Could we look at the the wine list.

48
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:35,190
Could we look at the wine list.

49
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:36,830
Could we look at the wine list.

50
00:03:36,970 --> 00:03:43,660
And then once we decide we look at the wine list if we want to order wine now for alcohol.

51
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:55,480
Now alcohol alcohol is maybe red wine white wine beer maybe whiskey maybe vodka or a cocktail perhaps

52
00:03:55,780 --> 00:03:56,880
maybe a cocktail.

53
00:03:56,890 --> 00:03:59,160
All of these things are called alcohol.

54
00:03:59,170 --> 00:04:06,790
Alcohol wine is usually just red and white made from grapes just to be clear that's what

55
00:04:06,790 --> 00:04:07,850
wine is.

56
00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:15,240
Alcohol is a broad category which includes every kind of drink like this on the wine list at the top.

57
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:22,330
There's often something that says House red and house white.

58
00:04:22,330 --> 00:04:25,960
This doesn't mean that this is the best wine at the restaurant.

59
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:27,760
The house is the restaurant.

60
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:34,240
If you ever hear the phrase on the house on the house that means that you don't need to pay it's free.

61
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:40,570
For example if your food is an hour late and you waited and you're starving they say Oh I'm so sorry

62
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:42,250
for you know waiting.

63
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:44,110
Everything is on the house.

64
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:45,270
They'll pay for your meal.

65
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:46,870
It's on the house.

66
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:52,540
So if you see House red house white basically what that means is this is our basic wine.

67
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:54,600
This is the wine that we recommend.

68
00:04:54,610 --> 00:04:59,820
It's usually not super expensive maybe not the cheapest but close to the bottom.

69
00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:03,370
It's sort of like their standard.

70
00:05:03,390 --> 00:05:05,520
It's sort of like their standard wine.

71
00:05:05,530 --> 00:05:08,480
So here comes the waitress with the drinks.

72
00:05:08,650 --> 00:05:12,260
Here's your wine here's your Coca-Cola Here's your water whatever.

73
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:13,670
Oh thank you so much.

74
00:05:13,690 --> 00:05:15,390
Course you can just say thank you.

75
00:05:15,390 --> 00:05:16,150
Say thanks.

76
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:17,140
Thank you.

77
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:20,220
And then she'll usually ask you ready to order.

78
00:05:20,230 --> 00:05:21,400
Are you ready to order.

79
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:22,990
Have you decided what you'd like.

80
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:28,330
Sometimes she'll say have you decided.

81
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:33,760
And then if you haven't decided what should you say you're still thinking right you're still thinking.

82
00:05:33,790 --> 00:05:35,020
So that's what you should say.

83
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:37,690
That's the common phrase actually.

84
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:49,510
Actually we're still thinking we're still thinking we're still thinking please could you please could

85
00:05:49,510 --> 00:05:59,230
you please give us another minute could you please give us another minute could you please give us another

86
00:05:59,230 --> 00:05:59,730
minute.

87
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:00,930
We need a minute.

88
00:06:00,940 --> 00:06:01,800
We need a minute.

89
00:06:01,810 --> 00:06:09,730
The one that I usually use is not quite not quite simply a lower case cube.

90
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:10,830
Not quite.

91
00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:19,700
We or I are still thinking I am still I'm still thinking I'm still thinking.

92
00:06:20,350 --> 00:06:22,690
And then you could add could you please give me another minute.

93
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:25,640
That's OK if you put both of those together.

94
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:26,860
That's not a problem.

95
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:31,490
Still thinking Could you please give us or give me another minute.

96
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:32,560
No problem.

97
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:37,990
Then she'll say OK sure I'll check on you in a couple minutes or.

98
00:06:37,990 --> 00:06:39,370
Sure no problem.
