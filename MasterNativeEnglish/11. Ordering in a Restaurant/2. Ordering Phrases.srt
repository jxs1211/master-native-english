1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:06,390
So whether you're in a restaurant or not there are some common ways to ask for things and we've looked

2
00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:09,120
at a couple of these phrases before.

3
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:11,490
So some of this will be review.

4
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:16,370
But we do want to talk about a couple of key phrases especially for being in a restaurant.

5
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:21,900
We can say of course I'd like you can say this on an airplane.

6
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:23,610
You can say this in a restaurant.

7
00:00:23,610 --> 00:00:26,610
You can say this to your friend do you need anything.

8
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:30,030
Yeah I'd like a glass of water that's a little bit too polite.

9
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:34,940
In some situations but especially if you're on an airplane if you're at a restaurant.

10
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:36,570
Very very common.

11
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:41,200
I'll have you go to Starbucks and you want to order a coffee.

12
00:00:41,210 --> 00:00:43,850
You could say I'll have a cappuccino.

13
00:00:43,910 --> 00:00:44,810
I'll have a latte.

14
00:00:44,810 --> 00:00:47,970
I'll have an Americano whatever you want to have.

15
00:00:47,990 --> 00:00:49,600
Or you can make it a question.

16
00:00:49,610 --> 00:00:55,610
Could I please have that question.

17
00:00:55,730 --> 00:00:57,230
Could I please have an Americano.

18
00:00:57,260 --> 00:00:59,650
Or could I please have a menu.

19
00:00:59,660 --> 00:01:03,640
Could I please have diet coke whatever you want to say.

20
00:01:03,770 --> 00:01:05,020
Very common as well.

21
00:01:05,030 --> 00:01:13,400
Sometimes we may want to express a little bit less certainty and so we might say I guess I guess I'll

22
00:01:13,670 --> 00:01:20,240
take this is just a way to make it sound a little bit more casual perhaps.

23
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:23,720
I guess I'll take the chicken burrito chicken burrito.

24
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:29,140
Yeah sometimes it also shows that you're not totally confident about your choice.

25
00:01:29,150 --> 00:01:30,320
Can I get.

26
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:31,080
Can.

27
00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:32,690
Can I get.

28
00:01:32,690 --> 00:01:35,950
Can I get a glass of red wine please.

29
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:39,400
And this is also a question Can I get a glass of red wine please.

30
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:39,750
OK.

31
00:01:39,770 --> 00:01:44,930
And then finally I think I'll order.

32
00:01:44,930 --> 00:01:48,860
I think I'll order the chocolate cake for dessert.

33
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:50,330
I think I'll order the chocolate cake.

34
00:01:50,330 --> 00:01:56,090
So these are basically if you know how to use these well these are the most common phrases for asking

35
00:01:56,090 --> 00:01:57,030
for what you want.

36
00:01:57,170 --> 00:02:02,360
If you stop this lesson right now stop watching at least you have this.

37
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:09,410
These are the basics but we are going to go into how they're used in context remember we do things in

38
00:02:09,410 --> 00:02:16,910
context and the reason that we do everything in context in this situation with real examples is because

39
00:02:16,910 --> 00:02:23,030
just knowing one sentence makes it hard to actually then use because you're not sure if that one sentence

40
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,890
exactly fits right.

41
00:02:24,890 --> 00:02:31,310
So when we look at examples you can get a better feeling for how these phrases are used.

42
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:37,430
So we'll go through a real situation ordering in a restaurant and leading up to ordering.

43
00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:38,570
So let's let's do that.
