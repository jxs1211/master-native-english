1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:02,670
Sometimes you can't finish everything.

2
00:00:02,730 --> 00:00:07,390
And it was a great meal and you still have what are called leftovers.

3
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:15,530
Leftovers from your meal you want to take them home put them in the refrigerator so you ask the waiter

4
00:00:15,530 --> 00:00:16,940
or waitress as you're leaving.

5
00:00:16,940 --> 00:00:20,670
Hey could excuse me could we get a to go box for this.

6
00:00:20,750 --> 00:00:25,790
They'll bring you a box a to go box or a box to take this away.

7
00:00:25,790 --> 00:00:28,310
Could we get a box to take this away.

8
00:00:28,340 --> 00:00:33,710
Could you wrap this up to go to go and then they will take your food back to the kitchen.

9
00:00:33,710 --> 00:00:35,140
Sometimes they'll do that for you.

10
00:00:35,150 --> 00:00:36,920
Could you wrap this up to go.

11
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:38,500
So if you need a box.

12
00:00:38,660 --> 00:00:40,770
Could we have to go box for this.

13
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:50,140
Or could we have a box box to take this away.

14
00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:51,470
Very common.

15
00:00:51,470 --> 00:00:53,360
Just in case you need to do that.

16
00:00:53,360 --> 00:01:01,040
So I wanted to mention those because there are many times when the first cut you don't want to waste

17
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:01,130
it.

18
00:01:01,130 --> 00:01:01,970
You can't leave it here.

19
00:01:01,970 --> 00:01:04,550
Take it home eat it for lunch tomorrow.

20
00:01:04,580 --> 00:01:06,170
That is a good idea.

21
00:01:06,830 --> 00:01:13,580
So we've gone through the whole restaurant situation common phrases for asking for things how to interact

22
00:01:13,580 --> 00:01:19,880
with the waiter or waitress how to interact with the hostess or host how to sit down and ask for a menu

23
00:01:19,910 --> 00:01:25,480
how to order how to pay how to do all that stuff but to really get it.

24
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:32,630
You need to do it to find an online menu and record yourself ordering different combinations of things

25
00:01:33,230 --> 00:01:34,470
from the menu.

26
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:35,370
Practice it.

27
00:01:35,390 --> 00:01:42,770
Do it a few times and then if you can really do it go to a restaurant that's an English speaking restaurant

28
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:47,600
as soon as you can whether you're traveling you're on a trip be the one to order.

29
00:01:47,630 --> 00:01:49,140
You've got to really practice it.

30
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:56,060
So first record yourself doing it get comfortable with it then the next time you're in an English speaking

31
00:01:56,060 --> 00:01:57,290
restaurant.

32
00:01:57,290 --> 00:01:58,970
Try these things out.

33
00:01:58,970 --> 00:02:00,730
See how easy it is.

34
00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:01,100
All right.

35
00:02:01,130 --> 00:02:01,550
Good luck.
