1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:07,070
So let's say that we're not going to McDonald's or a fast food place at a place like that.

2
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:13,920
You don't need a waiter let's say we're going to a place where there is a waiter and you're going to

3
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:18,270
sit down sometimes we call this a sit down restaurant.

4
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:24,540
OK or we sometimes say that we're dining in but we often say it's a sit down restaurant which means

5
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:28,650
it's a little bit more formal when you walk into the restaurant.

6
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:31,700
The person at the door is actually not the waiter.

7
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:41,040
Probably that person may be called a host or a hostess hostess a man and a hostess is a woman waiter

8
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:46,470
is a man waitress is a woman host hostess waiter waitress.

9
00:00:46,470 --> 00:00:46,890
OK.

10
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:53,190
Now this person the host or hostess is the person who greets you at the door takes you to your table

11
00:00:53,490 --> 00:01:03,270
or maybe checks your reservation, a reservation means that you have called beforehand to

12
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:05,910
to actually get a table.

13
00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:06,430
Right.

14
00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:07,560
And that's very simple.

15
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:18,720
You would just say you would call the restaurant and say I'd like to book or reserve a table for

16
00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:28,160
six under and then your family name maybe Jones under Jones or I'd like to book a table for six.

17
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:29,920
Then they'll say what time.

18
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:32,120
And you say oh seven thirty.

19
00:01:32,150 --> 00:01:32,420
OK.

20
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:37,630
And what's the name Jones if you want to say it altogether you can.

21
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:42,660
But the person on the phone will probably miss some details if you say I'd like to book or reserve a

22
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:46,200
table for six under Jones at seven thirty.

23
00:01:46,220 --> 00:01:47,650
They're writing all that down.

24
00:01:47,730 --> 00:01:51,850
So just say a little bit first and you could even start with the very beginning.

25
00:01:51,930 --> 00:01:52,160
Hello.

26
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:54,860
I'd like to book a table for six.

27
00:01:54,930 --> 00:01:55,460
OK.

28
00:01:55,460 --> 00:01:56,480
Short what time.

29
00:01:56,490 --> 00:01:57,410
Seven thirty.

30
00:01:57,420 --> 00:01:57,700
OK.

31
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:59,600
A Table For Six at seven thirty.

32
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:01,520
And what's the name.

33
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:02,780
It's JONES OK.

34
00:02:02,970 --> 00:02:03,300
Great.

35
00:02:03,330 --> 00:02:07,180
So it's a table for six at seven thirty under Jones.

36
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,070
Yep that's correct.

37
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:08,410
OK.

38
00:02:08,450 --> 00:02:09,680
Thank you very much.

39
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:11,120
That's very simple.

40
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:11,540
OK.

41
00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:18,780
When you walk into the restaurant then if you have that reservation one common question that the host

42
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:24,760
or hostess may ask you this person may ask you is do you have a reservation.

43
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:29,080
Do you have a reservation.

44
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:36,940
And the answer if it's yes it's a yes I have a table for six and you'd say the same information they

45
00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:38,440
might say OK what's the name.

46
00:02:38,530 --> 00:02:41,030
Yes I have a reservation at seven thirty.

47
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:41,790
What's the name.

48
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,920
It's JONES OK.

49
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:44,290
Great.

50
00:02:44,710 --> 00:02:49,420
Now if they don't ask this question or if you don't have a reservation and you go in and they say Do

51
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:50,780
you have a reservation.

52
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:51,850
You say no.

53
00:02:51,910 --> 00:02:58,120
Or they ask you directly how many how many people or how many how many.

54
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:07,280
Or how many people then you just say how many people we have six six people or we need or I need.

55
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:07,960
OK.

56
00:03:08,050 --> 00:03:14,110
We need a table for six A Table For Six.

57
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:14,530
OK.

58
00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:15,780
We're at the restaurant.

59
00:03:15,850 --> 00:03:17,640
Maybe you have to wait a few minutes.

60
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:21,530
They might say Oh well unfortunately we don't have a table right now.

61
00:03:21,550 --> 00:03:23,820
There is a ten minute wait.

62
00:03:23,830 --> 00:03:24,960
Is that OK.

63
00:03:24,970 --> 00:03:25,990
Yeah that's all right.

64
00:03:25,990 --> 00:03:26,730
That's fine.

65
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:27,970
There's a ten minute wait.

66
00:03:27,970 --> 00:03:34,030
Well let's just start the situation fresh and make it simpler by saying we just have two people I want

67
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:35,710
to do it a little bit simpler.

68
00:03:35,710 --> 00:03:41,860
We've done the reservation thing so let's just say we walk into the restaurant there's a hostess and

69
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:44,410
she just says how many.

70
00:03:44,410 --> 00:03:52,830
And it's me and another person and I say a table for two please table a table for two please.

71
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:55,740
And I should actually have a comma there a table for two please.

72
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:59,560
And she could ask me and brought a reservation but we've set a table for two.

73
00:03:59,590 --> 00:04:00,920
We know how to do that.

74
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:01,540
All right.

75
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:06,190
Now I want to make a specific request I say.

76
00:04:06,190 --> 00:04:08,670
She says ok and I say do you.

77
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:16,670
Do you have any seats or tables by the window by the window.

78
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:19,100
Do you have any seats or tables by the window.

79
00:04:19,130 --> 00:04:20,630
Don't say seats or tables.

80
00:04:20,630 --> 00:04:23,170
Say do you have any seats by the window.

81
00:04:23,210 --> 00:04:28,000
Do you have any tables by a window or whatever you want to say OK.

82
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:29,660
Yeah we do.

83
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:30,460
We do.

84
00:04:30,530 --> 00:04:31,690
Or let me check.

85
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:32,150
Let me check.

86
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:33,060
Maybe she doesn't know.

87
00:04:33,050 --> 00:04:35,420
She might say Let me check.

88
00:04:35,450 --> 00:04:36,110
Let me check.

89
00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:36,980
Let me see.

90
00:04:37,130 --> 00:04:38,560
Yes we do.

91
00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:39,920
Right this way.

92
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:47,920
Right this way please follow me and then I usually say Oh great great.

93
00:04:47,930 --> 00:04:50,480
Then I follow her or him if it's a host.

94
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:50,680
OK.

95
00:04:50,710 --> 00:04:57,750
So that's the first part we know how to do a reservation when they ask how many we say a table for two.

96
00:04:57,770 --> 00:04:59,170
We could just say two.

97
00:04:59,270 --> 00:05:04,750
And then if we need to make a specific request we say Oh and could we get a table by the window.

98
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:09,820
Could we get a table next to the bar or far away from the bar or whatever you want to say.
