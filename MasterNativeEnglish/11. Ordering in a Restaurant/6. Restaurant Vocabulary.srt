1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:05,970
Now before we go on to our actual example here let's just make sure we're clear on all the words you

2
00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:07,810
can write these down again.

3
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:09,930
You can look these up very easily.

4
00:00:09,930 --> 00:00:16,920
These are not the only words you need to know but an on tray is often the main dish and will include

5
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:23,670
for example of some meat and then a couple of other things on the plate like a vegetable and then maybe

6
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:34,900
another thing like mashed potatoes and vegetables or corn and bread or some other small dish.

7
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:36,960
So usually that's called an entree.

8
00:00:36,990 --> 00:00:44,190
And so on that on a plate then you have an appetizer which is something that comes before and that's

9
00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:48,220
meant to give you something to eat before you get your your main course.

10
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:54,210
Your main course now main course is not something that's only used in a restaurant that's used for eating

11
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:55,740
in general in English.

12
00:00:55,750 --> 00:01:02,190
It's the main food that you eat but it's the idea of relieving your hunger right at the beginning and

13
00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:07,100
you'll see that usually those are a little bit cheaper and they say appetizer.

14
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:14,340
The menu is the thing you order from the wine list is also a type of menu but it's it's usually for

15
00:01:14,370 --> 00:01:21,360
just wine and sometimes they have a drinks menu as well which is another separate menu where they have

16
00:01:21,690 --> 00:01:27,830
alcohol so other types of alcohol might be on yet another menu.

17
00:01:27,830 --> 00:01:28,420
OK.

18
00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:37,980
Just to be clear this is red wine and white wine and this might include whiskey bourbon Gin Gin and

19
00:01:37,980 --> 00:01:42,750
Vodka cocktails and cocktails are mixed drinks.

20
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:49,550
Right these are straight straight alcohol bourbon whiskey gin vodka cocktails are a mix.

21
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:50,580
Maybe they're sweeter.

22
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:57,260
They have other things inside and they include whiskey bourbon gin vodka rum as well.

23
00:01:57,330 --> 00:02:02,630
There are lots of different types of of alcohol OK a dessert actually what.

24
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:03,370
Wait a second.

25
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:04,530
Here's my second s.

26
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:08,440
Here's an interesting mistake that can teach us something.

27
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:15,870
One way to remember the correct spelling of the word dessert is that you always want more dessert because

28
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:16,950
it's sweet.

29
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:20,440
So you have two S's because you always want more.

30
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:22,210
That's how you spell dessert.

31
00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:27,740
If there's one s That's dessert which is a very very dry place.

32
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:31,470
So this is an accident but I'm trying to use it as as a teaching point.

33
00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:33,680
So desert is a dry place.

34
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:41,940
It's very dry and a desert D E S S E R T V cake or pie or something sweet after you eat which is what

35
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:49,950
I meant to write host and hostess as we talked about the person who greets you and then a waiter waitress

36
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:55,830
the person who brings you your food the person who will get your tips directly in a western restaurant

37
00:02:55,830 --> 00:02:59,040
especially in America especially in America.

38
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:00,860
Tips are very important.

39
00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:06,690
That's extra money that the waiter or waitress and also the host or hostess will get at the end of a

40
00:03:06,690 --> 00:03:12,270
day and they get that from money that the customers in the restaurant give.

41
00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:13,580
They choose how much.

42
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:19,800
We'll talk about that later sides basically these things might include a small salad or another little

43
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:26,430
thing that you order maybe it's not an appetizer but like an appetizer that comes with your entree.

44
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:27,280
OK.

45
00:03:27,330 --> 00:03:28,430
Catch of the day.

46
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:30,700
Sometimes you'll see this catch.

47
00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:32,820
It's for fishing.

48
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:34,320
So this is going to be a fish.

49
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:36,550
Whatever fish they have.

50
00:03:36,570 --> 00:03:38,130
This is going to be the catch of the day.

51
00:03:38,130 --> 00:03:39,400
This is what they have today.

52
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:41,790
Dressing dressing is a kind of sauce.

53
00:03:41,790 --> 00:03:43,920
There are many different types of dressing.

54
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:45,800
It goes on salad.

55
00:03:46,230 --> 00:03:47,560
Put it on your salad.

56
00:03:47,670 --> 00:03:53,520
So if you order a salad you might get a thousand island you might get Italian you might get vinaigrette

57
00:03:53,550 --> 00:03:55,060
vinaigrette is my favorite.

58
00:03:55,230 --> 00:03:57,690
OK and then toppings might be for a salad.

59
00:03:57,690 --> 00:04:03,960
These are things that you add to the top of the salad maybe extra like cheese like onions like other

60
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:09,710
vegetables and also for example if you order a pizza you also maybe add toppings.

61
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:16,590
So the cheese is usually not considered a topping on a pizza because that's an important part of pizza.

62
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:22,920
Green peppers and onions and black olives or sausage or whatever else you like to put on that.

63
00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:25,770
That is called a topping toppings.

64
00:04:25,790 --> 00:04:26,370
OK.

65
00:04:26,490 --> 00:04:32,350
As we talked about a reservation or a booking but at a restaurant it's usually called a reservation.

66
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:40,290
When you call before and you get a time and pasta is a very popular thing at Western restaurants especially

67
00:04:40,290 --> 00:04:41,240
in America.

68
00:04:41,370 --> 00:04:43,470
They might often have some kind of pasta.

69
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:49,730
This is basically noodles but it's Italian style noodles and there are many different forms of that.

70
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:50,910
And it's not only noodles.

71
00:04:50,910 --> 00:04:57,060
Actually many different forms it's a special thing that's basically only Italian and noodles are always

72
00:04:57,150 --> 00:04:57,870
long and thin.

73
00:04:57,870 --> 00:05:01,040
Pasta is not always long and thin.

74
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:01,290
All right.

75
00:05:01,470 --> 00:05:07,450
So those are some words I just want to make sure you know and I'm sure you know many of those.

76
00:05:07,590 --> 00:05:11,180
But I just want to make sure you know those before we go on to our example.
