1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:06,990
Of course there will be times when you really just don't know what you want the best person to ask is

2
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:12,540
your waiter or your waitress right there the first person that you should ask because they've seen so

3
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:13,890
many people order.

4
00:00:13,890 --> 00:00:20,610
They know what people like and they've probably tried everything on the menu.

5
00:00:20,610 --> 00:00:22,230
Probably right.

6
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:26,120
So they're the first person you should go to.

7
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:28,690
How can you ask them for their advice.

8
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:29,570
You really have no idea.

9
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:30,750
Everything looks so good.

10
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:35,030
You can say that everything on the menu looks so good.

11
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:39,690
I'm having trouble deciding I'm having trouble deciding what to get.

12
00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:42,130
Everything looks so great.

13
00:00:42,230 --> 00:00:44,140
Now they might ask you a specific question.

14
00:00:44,150 --> 00:00:45,870
Do you like fish.

15
00:00:45,950 --> 00:00:49,250
Are you looking for something vegetarian.

16
00:00:49,250 --> 00:00:52,070
Do you prefer chicken or beef chicken or beef.

17
00:00:52,070 --> 00:00:53,330
Do you prefer chicken or beef.

18
00:00:53,330 --> 00:00:58,620
And then based on that maybe she can make a recommendation or you really have no idea.

19
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:01,880
Just tell me what would you suggest.

20
00:01:01,970 --> 00:01:07,100
What would you suggest or what's popular here.

21
00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:09,770
What's popular on the menu.

22
00:01:09,770 --> 00:01:14,850
What's hot on the menu or sometimes what's popular here what do people often order.

23
00:01:14,870 --> 00:01:18,280
What do people people often order.

24
00:01:19,070 --> 00:01:22,720
The I hate tuna is really popular here.

25
00:01:23,090 --> 00:01:27,590
He I think it's a guy that I could be wrong.

26
00:01:27,610 --> 00:01:30,770
He tuna the ahi tuna is really popular here.

27
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:37,580
That's a very popular item on the menu item popular item on the menu.

28
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:38,730
That sounds really good.

29
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:39,920
I love tuna.

30
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:41,080
I'll have that.

31
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:46,680
So the waitress has recommended something and I have taken her recommendation because one I love tuna

32
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:49,230
and two I have no idea.

33
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:52,080
So she must know what's really good in this restaurant.

34
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:53,820
Sometimes I even say that.

35
00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:55,050
Well what's your favorite thing.

36
00:01:55,050 --> 00:01:56,470
What do you like.

37
00:01:56,490 --> 00:01:58,870
Sometimes I will ask that question too.

38
00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:01,820
We can also say what do you recommend.

39
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:03,990
What are the specials today.

40
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:06,560
This best shows today.

41
00:02:06,570 --> 00:02:12,930
Many restaurants have something that they call a special each day that could be a certain type of fish

42
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,690
or maybe a specific dish.

43
00:02:15,690 --> 00:02:16,320
Right.

44
00:02:16,350 --> 00:02:17,930
A dish.

45
00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:20,700
And it depends on the day.

46
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:21,810
Monday Tuesday Wednesday.

47
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,500
Maybe they have different specials.

48
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:26,150
And the waiter or waitress might tell you about those.

49
00:02:26,190 --> 00:02:33,110
Oh today we're doing a special on we're doing a special on tacos type of Mexican food.

50
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:36,700
Our special tuna tacos tuna tacos.

51
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:39,180
OK sounds good.

52
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:40,580
Sounds good I'll try that.

53
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:42,130
Those are the specials.

54
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:48,120
So don't worry if you can't decide at a restaurant you can ask for advice you can use these expressions

55
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:49,250
these ways to ask.

56
00:02:49,350 --> 00:02:52,100
And there are others of course you can mix these around as well.
