1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:07,200
When we're talking with friends or maybe in a more formal situation like a job interview we need to

2
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:11,720
ask what other people are going to do what other people might do.

3
00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:18,990
So let's just go over very quickly for common questions that we can use to ask about the future.

4
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:25,150
The first three are more casual and then the last one is a bit more formal.

5
00:00:25,310 --> 00:00:26,710
OK so the first one.

6
00:00:26,790 --> 00:00:30,690
What have you got going on today.

7
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:32,040
Very common.

8
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:33,420
You talk to your friend.

9
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:35,730
It's morning maybe or it's early afternoon.

10
00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:37,800
What have you got going on today.

11
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:39,210
This is about the future.

12
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:42,070
It means basically what are your plans today.

13
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:46,990
Now you could say that we could say what are your plans today.

14
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:49,290
What are your plans this weekend.

15
00:00:49,290 --> 00:00:51,360
What are your plans next week.

16
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:54,340
What are your plans for your vacation.

17
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:56,130
What are your plans this afternoon.

18
00:00:56,130 --> 00:01:01,380
This one is really useful because we can talk about any time but it's about the future.

19
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:11,340
But what have you got going on is usually going to be today or maybe this week very near term very near

20
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:13,260
near term future.

21
00:01:13,370 --> 00:01:14,340
But it's pretty common.

22
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:16,220
Do you have anything going on later.

23
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:20,910
This one is something we might use in the invitation situation.

24
00:01:20,910 --> 00:01:23,180
We did the class about inviting right.

25
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:24,590
If we're going to invite someone.

26
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:30,420
Do you have anything going on later this is maybe when we're preparing to ask them if they want to do

27
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:31,220
something.

28
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:34,440
Probably we want to hang out or do something fun.

29
00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:35,790
What are your plans.

30
00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:40,890
Sometimes we can just say this by itself but usually it does have a time on it.

31
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:46,140
So these are these three common very common casual pretty casual.

32
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:46,740
OK.

33
00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:49,050
Where do you see yourself in three years now.

34
00:01:49,050 --> 00:01:56,090
This is something that you would hear in a serious conversation with a friend about their life goals.

35
00:01:56,090 --> 00:01:56,340
Right.

36
00:01:56,550 --> 00:01:56,820
OK.

37
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:59,080
So you're thinking about quitting your job.

38
00:01:59,100 --> 00:01:59,480
All right.

39
00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:00,370
No problem.

40
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:02,990
Where do you see yourself in three years.

41
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:06,030
That means what do you imagine about yourself in three years.

42
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:11,160
It's also a very very common job interview question.

43
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:14,460
They will often ask you where do you see yourself in five years.

44
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:19,440
So then we can maybe explain something about our goals and if it's a job interview maybe that should

45
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:21,910
be related to this job probably.

46
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:27,720
We'll look at an example of how we can answer that question later in this lesson.
