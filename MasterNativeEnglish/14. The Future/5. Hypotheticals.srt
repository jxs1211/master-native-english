1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:05,850
Now this is mostly review I just want to make sure we're very clear on hypotheticals so that we understand

2
00:00:05,850 --> 00:00:11,210
the basic grammar structure so that you're able to use it for the next part.

3
00:00:11,210 --> 00:00:13,320
When we talk about possibilities.

4
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:20,490
So just as a review a hypothetical is something that we imagine that is not true and may never be true

5
00:00:20,790 --> 00:00:23,970
if monkeys could fly if monkeys could fly.

6
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:25,370
They would rule the earth.

7
00:00:25,660 --> 00:00:28,380
OK so we can just imagine anything that way.

8
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:31,620
If people lived on Mars then I would go there.

9
00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:34,710
We can talk about our actions if another thing happens.

10
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:37,590
That's what you would do but it may never happen.

11
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:42,760
OK if would if I would if I lived in Beijing.

12
00:00:42,810 --> 00:00:48,120
Notice that we use the past tense here and we're using past tense even though it's not really in the

13
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:49,080
past is it.

14
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:49,460
No.

15
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:52,680
If I lived in Beijing I would never take the subway.

16
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:56,220
Could we say I would never take the subway if I lived in Beijing.

17
00:00:56,220 --> 00:00:57,890
The answer is yes.

18
00:00:57,900 --> 00:01:04,020
But just as before we would take out that comma OK same thing.

19
00:01:04,020 --> 00:01:07,350
If I were a doctor I would charge less.

20
00:01:07,410 --> 00:01:10,770
So maybe I think doctors charge too much money.

21
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:13,780
If I were a doctor I would charge less.

22
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:18,460
I can say that because I'm not a doctor and I probably never will be.

23
00:01:18,460 --> 00:01:22,240
In fact I'm pretty sure I won't be but if I were.

24
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:31,410
Now notice we use were here if you were if she was if he was if we were we use this to create hypothetical

25
00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:38,270
use if then we say I would she would they would would is very important here.

26
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:41,260
It tells us that it isn't real.

27
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:43,710
It tells us that we are just imagining it.

28
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:50,070
These are a little bit different because lived in the past tense but actually they're very similar because

29
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:55,170
I don't live in Beijing and may never I'm not a doctor and may never be.

30
00:01:55,170 --> 00:01:59,680
So this has to be very very clear because this is so common in English.

31
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:07,830
It's very important that you really understand how to use this type of sentence so we know how to talk

32
00:02:07,830 --> 00:02:10,950
about our intentions and our actions.

33
00:02:10,950 --> 00:02:18,480
The cause of the result which is what we do and we know how to talk about hypotheticals things we imagine

34
00:02:18,490 --> 00:02:23,520
so let's kind of bring all this together and talk about back to our topic.

35
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:30,900
Future Possibilities things that may or may not happen often these are things that are out of our control

36
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:41,070
or we could also often say out of our hands it's out of your hands that means you have no control over

37
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:47,520
some part of it but if you have no control over some thing that may or may not happen in the future

38
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:50,640
you can talk about actions that you will do.

39
00:02:50,670 --> 00:03:00,180
If this happens or if this happens you can talk about actions that will happen whether or not this happens.

40
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:04,150
So that might be a little bit difficult to understand but let me explain.

41
00:03:04,170 --> 00:03:04,580
OK.

42
00:03:04,710 --> 00:03:06,910
OK it may rain tomorrow it may not.

43
00:03:06,990 --> 00:03:11,150
If it doesn't rain tomorrow I guess we can go to the zoo.

44
00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:14,200
So maybe a father is speaking to his children.

45
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:16,620
Children say Can we go to the zoo tomorrow.

46
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:22,750
Well if it doesn't rain tomorrow I guess means that's OK I guess we can go to the zoo.

47
00:03:22,890 --> 00:03:25,710
If it does rain tomorrow will we go to the zoo.

48
00:03:25,710 --> 00:03:27,290
No no we will not.

49
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:27,600
OK.

50
00:03:27,990 --> 00:03:32,380
If I go to Canada next year I will stay in Toronto.

51
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:36,860
Now maybe I have some control over whether or not I go to Canada.

52
00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:40,780
We don't know all of the details in that situation.

53
00:03:40,830 --> 00:03:43,280
If I go where will I stay.

54
00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:47,040
TORONTO If I don't go I won't go to Toronto.

55
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:50,190
But I have the next action sort of ready.

56
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:57,320
I have the next plan ready for if this thing does happen and it may or may not.

57
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:05,070
If my English improves I should be able to get that accounting job so maybe this course is helping you

58
00:04:05,070 --> 00:04:10,560
improve your English and there are many other things you can do to improve your English if your English

59
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:11,370
improves.

60
00:04:11,370 --> 00:04:15,900
What will happen if my English improves I can get that accounting job.

61
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:22,560
You have this job you really really want to be an accountant maybe in an international company.

62
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:24,060
And the result.

63
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:25,110
That thing that you want.

64
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:29,520
It depends on whether or not your English gets better.

65
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:31,340
If it doesn't well you get the job.

66
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:31,820
No.

67
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:38,420
If my English doesn't improve well then I guess I'll just stay at my current job.

68
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:43,870
So again we have two possibilities because we really don't know what's going to happen here.

69
00:04:43,890 --> 00:04:45,950
We can plan for the future this way.

70
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:50,530
This is how we talk about alternatives alternatives.

71
00:04:50,670 --> 00:04:53,080
An alternative is another choice.

72
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:57,900
You could do this or this or this or this and this is the grammar that we used to do that.

73
00:04:57,900 --> 00:04:59,360
This is how we express it.
