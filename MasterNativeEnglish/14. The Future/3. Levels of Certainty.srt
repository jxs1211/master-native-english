1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:04,920
So now you know some ways to ask about what's going to happen in the future.

2
00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:10,800
We need to actually know how to talk about the future but to do that we have to put them.

3
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:18,930
I think the different phrases into levels of certainty and the reason I think it makes sense to break

4
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:27,960
up the phrases into levels of certainty is because when we describe what may or will happen in the future

5
00:00:28,350 --> 00:00:36,660
we use phrases that show that either it must be in the future or we want it to be in the future or we

6
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:39,830
think it will happen in the future but we're not sure.

7
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:42,150
Or we just have no idea.

8
00:00:42,150 --> 00:00:44,340
OK so let's look at some of these.

9
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:47,750
The first one is the most certain we use.

10
00:00:47,790 --> 00:00:52,030
I'm going to and I will to be very clear about the future.

11
00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:56,830
We say for example I'm going to buy my bus ticket tomorrow.

12
00:00:56,910 --> 00:00:59,250
I'm going to buy my plane ticket tomorrow.

13
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:03,090
Now notice that I'm not saying I'm going to the supermarket.

14
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:09,550
That's a different I'M GOING TO THAT I'M GOING TO THE SUPERMARKET means you're actually driving or walking.

15
00:01:09,550 --> 00:01:09,830
OK.

16
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:10,730
That's a different one.

17
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:11,860
That's a different meaning.

18
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:15,380
This going to means will it's the same thing.

19
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:24,780
And then we say the action after going to we say I'm going to go I'm going to do so we use the simple

20
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:26,400
verb after it.

21
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:34,470
I'm going to buy I'm going to eat I'm going to meet my friend tomorrow at 3:00 p.m. I'm going to meet

22
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:43,650
my friend tomorrow at 3:00 p.m. I'm going to do my homework until about 10:00 we're very sure about

23
00:01:43,650 --> 00:01:51,630
these things it's certain we often connect times to it at 3:00 at 5:00 p.m. at 10 p.m. If we say I will

24
00:01:51,630 --> 00:02:02,310
it's the same thing I will be home by 10:00 I will be home by 10:00 I will buy you an iPad for Christmas

25
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:07,070
although you shouldn't tell people what you're going to get them for Christmas but it should be something

26
00:02:07,070 --> 00:02:13,120
you are certain about then when we have a little less certainty we just add probably to Will.

27
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:20,280
So by putting this here that means it's a little less clear I will probably get you a good birthday

28
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:28,230
gift or I will probably go downtown tomorrow I'm not sure something might happen to stop me from doing

29
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:28,500
that.

30
00:02:28,550 --> 00:02:29,060
OK.

31
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:36,410
I plan to again means that we really think that we will but maybe something will happen.

32
00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:43,170
So this one is pretty certain if we plan to do something but there are often when we have plans things

33
00:02:43,170 --> 00:02:47,590
that happen which are unexpected and what can we do about those things.

34
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:47,900
Right.

35
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:56,210
So I plan to take a vacation next summer to Japan next summer is maybe pretty far from now.

36
00:02:56,220 --> 00:02:57,720
It's a pretty long way off.

37
00:02:58,020 --> 00:03:02,660
So you plan to but something could happen right.

38
00:03:02,670 --> 00:03:09,120
It could even be something that happens today for example I plan to go shopping later this afternoon.

39
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:14,850
I plan to go shopping later this afternoon but we might say that when someone else has mentioned that

40
00:03:14,850 --> 00:03:21,030
they would like to do something with us that's different than that they might say I had planned to go

41
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:24,640
shopping which means maybe I'm about to change my plan.

42
00:03:24,810 --> 00:03:25,510
OK.

43
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,780
We can also use I'm planning to.

44
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:29,280
That's pretty common too.

45
00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:36,180
I'm planning to and often planning is for longer term things not so much near-term.

46
00:03:36,210 --> 00:03:38,430
You can but it's often for long term.

47
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:41,020
OK now we go down to the next level.

48
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:42,580
Less certain.

49
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,040
I'd like to.

50
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:46,270
This means that we just want it.

51
00:03:46,370 --> 00:03:51,930
It really has no connection to how sure we are about whether or not it will happen.

52
00:03:51,930 --> 00:03:54,660
I'd like to go to Seattle next week.

53
00:03:54,690 --> 00:03:55,770
I'd like to.

54
00:03:55,770 --> 00:03:58,800
I'd like to go on vacation next year to Europe.

55
00:03:58,800 --> 00:03:59,970
I'd like to.

56
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,200
We have no idea it might happen.

57
00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:03,410
It might not.

58
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:07,560
I might I might I might quit my job next year.

59
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:09,450
Now that means we're just thinking about it.

60
00:04:09,570 --> 00:04:11,920
I might quit my job next year.

61
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,170
Will it happen.

62
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:18,930
There's a chance because if I'm thinking about it that means that could lead to my action my quitting

63
00:04:18,930 --> 00:04:19,490
the job.

64
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:19,830
Right.

65
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:21,900
So OK it could happen.

66
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:30,690
I might I might I might buy a house I might buy a house this year I might say it's possible it's hard

67
00:04:30,690 --> 00:04:37,170
to put a percentage on that though I'm thinking about thinking about this is very similar to I might

68
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:42,930
very similar almost exactly the same I'm thinking about the only difference here is that we will use

69
00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:50,430
I and G I'm thinking about buying a house I'm thinking about asking my boss if I can come into work

70
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:57,530
late on Tuesdays because of my party's class I'm thinking about that will I do it.

71
00:04:57,540 --> 00:04:58,700
Maybe maybe not.

72
00:04:58,850 --> 00:05:00,340
Okay same as I might.

73
00:05:00,370 --> 00:05:03,000
But the grammar is a little different now if we say.

74
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:08,350
I hope we just have no idea the result could be this or this.

75
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:14,670
It could be a it could be B just have no clue so you could just say I hope I can get a good job.

76
00:05:14,770 --> 00:05:16,610
I hope I can get a good job.

77
00:05:16,690 --> 00:05:20,870
I hope I can go on vacation but you just have no clue.

78
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:25,290
It's totally uncertain the future is a mystery to you.

79
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:28,280
Oh I hope it doesn't rain tomorrow.

80
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:31,460
I hope it doesn't rain tomorrow.

81
00:05:31,630 --> 00:05:37,600
If you hope it doesn't rain tomorrow you really don't know and you definitely don't have any control

82
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:38,230
over that.

83
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:47,650
OK so we go this way when we decrease our certainty vs this one this one and this one are often used

84
00:05:47,650 --> 00:05:51,030
to express what we would like.

85
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:52,740
We're thinking about it.

86
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:54,730
Our desire.

87
00:05:54,730 --> 00:06:01,990
These two are a little less certain than the first two but are more like the first two because we do

88
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:06,450
have the intention to do that or at least we think it's likely.

89
00:06:06,610 --> 00:06:12,130
These are absolutely clear and this one is just yes no could be either one.

90
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:17,500
We could say a 50 50 chance a 50 50 chance.

91
00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:21,400
So these are the common phrases we use to discuss the future.

92
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:27,610
There are more but these are probably the most common and the most useful phrases that we can use when

93
00:06:27,610 --> 00:06:32,320
we want to explain our feelings our intentions about the future.
