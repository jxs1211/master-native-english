1
00:00:03,950 --> 00:00:10,290
And the last lesson we talked about how to give advice to a friend which is a very important part of

2
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:16,680
a relationship because friends help each other in this lesson we're going to talk about the future how

3
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:23,310
we can talk about the future how we can explain what we're going to do in the future or what we may

4
00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:24,600
do in the future.

5
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:27,300
Because some things are very certain.

6
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:28,980
Some things are not very certain.

7
00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:35,760
So we're going to talk about different phrases that we can use to describe how sure or how certain we

8
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:39,050
are about things that are going to happen in the future.

9
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:45,480
And then we're going to talk about the causes of our actions and the results how we explain cause and

10
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:52,110
result and we'll look at some useful ways to express cause and result as well as what that means.

11
00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:57,570
If you don't know then we'll talk about hypotheticals and I think you know what that means because we've

12
00:00:57,570 --> 00:01:03,270
talked about it before but then we need to do that because we have to talk about possibilities things

13
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:10,350
that may happen in the future because we use very very similar grammar sometimes exactly the same grammar

14
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:11,760
to explain that.

15
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:18,360
Then finally we're going to actually do a real example in a job interview because in a job interview

16
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:19,900
you need to talk about your future.

17
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:20,970
So let's get started.
