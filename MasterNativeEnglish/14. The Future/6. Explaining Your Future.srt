1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:07,740
So far in this lesson we've talked about phrases we can use to express different levels of certainty

2
00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:08,940
about the future.

3
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:11,810
We've talked about how we can ask questions about the future.

4
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:13,470
EXPRESS hypotheticals.

5
00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:20,850
Talk about our intentions and how we can explain different possibilities alternatives for the future

6
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:23,520
whether or not something happens.

7
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:28,510
Now we need to actually put it together in a real life situation in a job interview.

8
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:36,960
So let's imagine you're applying for a job in a big company and the job is related to finance finances.

9
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:41,730
Money related stuff and you're at the job interview you're sitting there.

10
00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:45,480
The other person maybe from H.R. is sitting across from you.

11
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:48,030
They ask you a really common question.

12
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:53,540
The question is So where do you see yourself in five years.

13
00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:56,060
And how will you get there.

14
00:00:56,070 --> 00:01:00,740
What that means is what do you imagine you'll be like in five years.

15
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:05,550
What do you imagine you'll be doing in terms of your career and maybe also your life.

16
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:07,100
And how will you get there.

17
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:14,850
That means what actions do you need to take in order to achieve that idea that you have about yourself

18
00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:16,290
in five years.

19
00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:21,650
You need to be able to clearly express your ideas about the future in this sort of answer.

20
00:01:21,690 --> 00:01:23,510
So let's practice an example.

21
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:30,330
I think it's really likely that I'll be working in a management capacity management capacity.

22
00:01:30,330 --> 00:01:32,710
Here just means some role.

23
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:35,690
Related to management or managing people.

24
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:43,890
A management role you could also say that some management capacity at some firm related to my field

25
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:45,270
of finance.

26
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:48,850
Be careful not to use major majors only when you're in school.

27
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:50,970
Once you leave school you have a field.

28
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,590
What's your field architecture finance accounting.

29
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:56,480
Maybe you're doing something in arts.

30
00:01:56,490 --> 00:01:58,110
Maybe you're a designer.

31
00:01:58,110 --> 00:02:00,360
Maybe your field is manufacturing.

32
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:04,690
If I'm hired here I will work toward that goal.

33
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:07,910
So we have a very clear expression of the future.

34
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:12,510
I will work toward that goal very certain very confident.

35
00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:19,680
And I think it would be a win win a win win means you get a benefit and I get a benefit.

36
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:26,190
I think it would be a win win because my attention to detail and knack for picking up new skills makes

37
00:02:26,190 --> 00:02:28,920
me I think an asset.

38
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:35,560
So a knack for something means you have a natural skill for that a natural ability to do that.

39
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:39,040
A knack for maybe understanding how people feel.

40
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:40,490
Learning languages.

41
00:02:40,650 --> 00:02:43,490
This person is saying I will do this.

42
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:45,200
This is my next action.

43
00:02:45,210 --> 00:02:46,820
I'm very certain about it.

44
00:02:46,890 --> 00:02:49,730
And then an expression about the future.

45
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:54,490
That's a little less certain but still pretty clear and expressing a desire.

46
00:02:54,510 --> 00:02:56,720
I think it would be a win win.

47
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:58,200
It would be a win win.

48
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:00,930
I'm hoping I'm hoping I'm hoping.

49
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:07,110
I hope it's the same thing that I can move to an upper management position although I obviously have

50
00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:12,750
a lot to learn using hope here means that you really don't know but that's your desire.

51
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:19,500
Remember it's completely uncertain what will happen but you can say you hope to express a desire.

52
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:26,610
If I do that means if I get a high level position an upper management position if I do means we're talking

53
00:03:26,610 --> 00:03:28,830
about possibilities alternatives.

54
00:03:28,830 --> 00:03:32,580
If I do I may work on getting an MBA.

55
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:38,550
If we want to be more certain here we could say if I do I will work on getting an MBA.

56
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:46,320
An MBA is an advanced degree related to business and often people will get an MBA as they continue their

57
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:50,250
career so they don't just quit their job and work on the MBA.

58
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:56,670
They may do them at the same time so that they can constantly increase their skill level and their knowledge

59
00:03:56,760 --> 00:04:02,160
regardless regardless means if it happens or not if it happens or not.

60
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:09,840
That means if I get my MBA or not regardless I'm going to constantly work to expand my knowledge of

61
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:14,860
the field and continue working on my English skills span means gets bigger.

62
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:23,280
Expand my knowledge of the field finances the field and continue working on my English skills as I realize

63
00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:26,870
my accent can sometimes be an issue for people.

64
00:04:27,090 --> 00:04:33,420
So if English is your second language and you speak English often at work but maybe you have a heavy

65
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:36,600
accent Your pronunciation is not so clear.

66
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:43,800
You can say that you're aware of that and then use that to express a desire to improve to acknowledge

67
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:44,640
that yes.

68
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:48,710
I realize this is something that's not perfect but I am working on it.

69
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:55,710
So if you say as I realize my accent can sometimes be an issue for people that doesn't mean that people

70
00:04:55,710 --> 00:05:02,990
don't like me because of my accent It means that maybe some time my accent can be a little bit heavy

71
00:05:03,110 --> 00:05:09,440
or thick THC okay and that might make it a little difficult for people to understand.

72
00:05:09,470 --> 00:05:13,000
Sometimes if you have a thick or heavy accent.

73
00:05:13,340 --> 00:05:18,480
I'm hoping this role will be the next big step in my career.

74
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:24,440
Again just expressing a desire and it's good to say I hope I hope if sometimes you don't have a lot

75
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:26,280
of control over the situation.

76
00:05:26,330 --> 00:05:29,150
They will decide if you get the job or not.

77
00:05:29,390 --> 00:05:34,010
All you can do is talk about what you will do if good things happen.

78
00:05:34,010 --> 00:05:38,960
If you get the job and you can express your desire that this you feel is a good fit.

79
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:41,650
This company is really where you want to be.

80
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:48,940
OK so hopefully you can see how these phrases come together in a natural way in a real situation.

81
00:05:48,950 --> 00:05:51,870
As usual we need to practice what we learn.

82
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:58,490
So here is your assignment with all of the words and phrases and different sentence structures that

83
00:05:58,490 --> 00:06:01,640
we practiced in this lesson.

84
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:02,480
Put it together.

85
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:05,200
Talk about what your future goals are.

86
00:06:05,210 --> 00:06:13,580
Explain them in detail and then explain the things you can do in the near term to reach those goals.

87
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:19,330
This is a good one because you have to talk about the near future which may be more certain more clear.

88
00:06:19,370 --> 00:06:21,080
I'm going to I will.

89
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:25,820
And talk about things that are farther in the future that you have less control over.

90
00:06:25,850 --> 00:06:26,580
I'd like to.

91
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:30,840
I hope and be sure to use some of the other expressions as well.

92
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:38,310
For example the alternatives using if to express what you might do if this happens or this happens.

93
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:43,450
OK try your best you can record yourself when you listen back to the recording.

94
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:47,360
Try to catch small mistakes write them down and then try it again.

95
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:54,770
In fact once you become more aware of your English speaking you can begin to pick out things that you

96
00:06:54,770 --> 00:06:55,660
can improve.

97
00:06:55,670 --> 00:06:59,560
Notice things that you can improve and over time get better.

98
00:06:59,630 --> 00:07:06,530
Even if you're not actually speaking with another person it is a good way to practice by yourself.

99
00:07:06,530 --> 00:07:07,190
All right.

100
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:07,700
Good luck.
