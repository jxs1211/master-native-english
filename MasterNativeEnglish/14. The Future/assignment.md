```
My goal is working with talented people from all over the world. Do what I really want to do and leverage my expertise to make team valuable.
I also want to live in a free and safe place.
I think it's really like that I'll working in a programming capacity in some stadio related to my field of programming.
Even through I'm working in China now, I'm still looking for a good chance to go aboardï¼Œand I work toward that goal. 
I think it would be win-win.
My attention to detail and knack for picking up new skills makes me, I think, an assert.

I hope I can move to a desired position and workplace that can provide more opportunities, although I obviously have a log to learn about this position.
If I do, I may work on getting CKA.
Regardless, I'm going to constantly work to expand my cloud native knowledge of the field, and continue to working on my both English and Franch skills. 
I'm hoping this role will be the next big step in my career.
