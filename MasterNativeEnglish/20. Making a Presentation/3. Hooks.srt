1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:03,840
So we've gone through the dos and don'ts of giving a presentation.

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:10,770
The last point I shared thing you should do is to engage the audience at the beginning with a hook.

3
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:12,510
Why am I doing this with my finger.

4
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:13,910
Because this is a hook.

5
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:16,500
This is a hook this shape.

6
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:18,010
We use it when we go fishing.

7
00:00:18,030 --> 00:00:20,330
We use it when we hang up our clothes.

8
00:00:20,370 --> 00:00:27,270
We can imagine grabbing the audience with that right at the beginning and making them focus on us.

9
00:00:27,270 --> 00:00:32,950
We use a hook to attract the attention of the audience at the beginning of a presentation.

10
00:00:32,970 --> 00:00:33,960
Pretty simple.

11
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:35,250
But how do we do that.

12
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:36,810
What kind of hooks are there.

13
00:00:36,810 --> 00:00:42,100
Well there are many but I want to talk about three and these three are very easy to do.

14
00:00:42,150 --> 00:00:42,870
Very easy.

15
00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:44,950
And I will teach you how to do them now.

16
00:00:45,130 --> 00:00:45,480
OK.

17
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:48,580
Start with a rhetorical question.

18
00:00:48,810 --> 00:00:50,460
What is a rhetorical question.

19
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:55,910
A rhetorical question is a question that doesn't need to be answered.

20
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:58,590
Doesn't need to be answered.

21
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:00,160
That's a rhetorical question.

22
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:03,290
Why would we use a rhetorical question.

23
00:01:03,490 --> 00:01:09,180
I see that's a rhetorical question I asked.

24
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:11,260
Why would we use a rhetorical question.

25
00:01:11,370 --> 00:01:14,290
Did you watching this go Oh I know.

26
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:15,480
No you didn't.

27
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:17,680
But you might have been thinking about the answer.

28
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:21,420
That is why we use rhetorical questions.

29
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:25,120
Have you ever wondered why people use rhetorical questions.

30
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:30,150
There is another a rhetorical question gets the audience to start thinking about the topic.

31
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:33,370
It's a great way to start a presentation.

32
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:39,900
And one really really simple honestly very simple beginning that you can use for pretty much any topic

33
00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:41,700
is to start with.

34
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:43,440
Have you ever.

35
00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:45,960
Have you ever.

36
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:47,530
Have you ever wondered.

37
00:01:47,530 --> 00:01:49,580
And then you can say something about your topic.

38
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:51,550
That's a pretty generic one.

39
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:53,610
Pretty generic but it works.

40
00:01:53,610 --> 00:01:54,560
Have you ever wondered.

41
00:01:54,690 --> 00:01:57,060
Let's say my topic is about Mars.

42
00:01:57,060 --> 00:02:05,770
Have you ever wondered what it would would be like to live on Mars.

43
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:08,250
Ever wondered what it would be like to live on Mars.

44
00:02:08,790 --> 00:02:11,490
Nobody in the audience needs to say oh yes yes yes.

45
00:02:11,490 --> 00:02:12,060
I've wondered.

46
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:12,600
Hello.

47
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:13,180
Meet me.

48
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,130
Can I answer.

49
00:02:14,130 --> 00:02:14,620
No.

50
00:02:14,730 --> 00:02:18,030
It's to get the audience to start thinking OK.

51
00:02:18,090 --> 00:02:24,510
So that is one way to begin a presentation and we can do a couple others we could say have.

52
00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:32,040
Have you ever wished Have you ever wished you could live 500 years.

53
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:35,970
Whatever the topic is it's not so important what the question is.

54
00:02:35,970 --> 00:02:37,340
It's got to be pretty open.

55
00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:39,150
Generally make people think.

56
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:40,590
But you can use Have you ever wished.

57
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:47,280
Have you ever wondered you'd say what's the most what's the most important thing.

58
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:53,430
You know that nobody taught you what's the most important thing that you know or the most important

59
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:55,980
thing you know that nobody taught you.

60
00:02:55,980 --> 00:03:00,750
Now again you don't have to answer that because you're in a room maybe full of people.

61
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:05,070
If that's an interview that maybe you have to answer it maybe it's not rhetorical but you don't have

62
00:03:05,070 --> 00:03:05,940
to go like this.

63
00:03:05,970 --> 00:03:07,840
You should just be thinking about it.

64
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:09,450
And it's very effective.

65
00:03:09,450 --> 00:03:11,330
I'm making you consider this topic.

66
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:18,420
Now I'm going to start talking about maybe something profound that I've learned through my life experience

67
00:03:18,690 --> 00:03:20,220
deep and meaningful.

68
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:25,590
Maybe I'm going to talk about how our experiences teach us profound and meaningful things.

69
00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:26,910
So this is one type.

70
00:03:26,970 --> 00:03:28,200
This is one type of hook.

71
00:03:28,350 --> 00:03:29,960
Let's go on to the next.

72
00:03:29,970 --> 00:03:30,240
OK.

73
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:34,480
The next type of hook is what I call making it personal.

74
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:38,290
There's something about humanity called empathy.

75
00:03:38,370 --> 00:03:46,170
And this is a kind of ability to feel how others feel especially for those who we have some real personal

76
00:03:46,170 --> 00:03:47,270
connection with.

77
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:53,730
For those who we actually meet face to face to be honest if you hear about something terrible happening

78
00:03:53,730 --> 00:03:58,060
to somebody you've never met or know nothing about.

79
00:03:58,140 --> 00:04:02,980
You probably think well that's sad but it might not completely ruin your day.

80
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:09,090
But when you hear about something bad that's happened to somebody you've met before you will naturally

81
00:04:09,090 --> 00:04:12,550
probably go and can't believe that happened.

82
00:04:12,550 --> 00:04:14,300
And it might ruin your day.

83
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:15,430
What's the difference.

84
00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:17,320
Well there's a connection there.

85
00:04:17,350 --> 00:04:25,810
There's a natural empathy that comes out more strongly when we see people face to face when we actually

86
00:04:25,810 --> 00:04:26,430
know people.

87
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:28,190
We have a real connection with them.

88
00:04:28,210 --> 00:04:35,680
So if there's a person there in front of me giving a presentation I naturally want to be connected with

89
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:36,520
them.

90
00:04:36,670 --> 00:04:44,270
And the more they talk about themselves maybe the more empathy I will have with them.

91
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:52,810
If they tell me why they care about a topic it's almost like they're taking me with them because I'm

92
00:04:52,810 --> 00:04:54,740
interested in them right.

93
00:04:54,790 --> 00:04:59,570
Because of empathy and they explain why they're interested in this topic.

94
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:02,790
Now I'm interested in the topic kind of through them.

95
00:05:02,830 --> 00:05:09,430
It's a weird thing but if you watch a lot of presentations especially good presentations you'll see

96
00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:16,630
that you'll see the person the presenter first share a little story a tiny little story to explain a

97
00:05:16,630 --> 00:05:25,030
little bit of background o you NDE to talk a little bit about why they care about that thing maybe or

98
00:05:25,030 --> 00:05:27,760
talk about how they first got interested in that.

99
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:30,790
Why are they're passionate about this topic that they're sharing.

100
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:33,860
Basically basically here are some ways we can do that.

101
00:05:33,910 --> 00:05:42,240
Well when I was about 7 when I was about 7 OK.

102
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:48,160
And maybe we're talking about maybe my presentation is about Mars like I said before when I was about

103
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:55,110
7 my father took me outside and I saw that he had brought a telescope home.

104
00:05:55,140 --> 00:05:55,470
Wow.

105
00:05:55,480 --> 00:06:00,600
A telescope a telescope is something you use to see far away.

106
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:02,520
And he said Son look through this.

107
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:03,120
And I did.

108
00:06:03,150 --> 00:06:10,650
And I saw a little blue orange disk and I couldn't believe that with my own eyes I could see another

109
00:06:10,650 --> 00:06:11,160
planet.

110
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:14,700
I could even see little little lines on the surface of the planet.

111
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:22,010
And from that point I've been fascinated by Mars had been fascinated by the idea of going there.

112
00:06:22,050 --> 00:06:23,310
Do you care already.

113
00:06:23,350 --> 00:06:29,910
Do you feel like wow I could be interested in Mars now because it's kind of happening through me right

114
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:30,690
now.

115
00:06:30,690 --> 00:06:36,720
One reason is because humans are naturally interested in stories but the other is because because of

116
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:39,730
empathy here are some other ways we could we could begin.

117
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:40,720
Let me tell you.

118
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:52,680
Let me tell you about how I first got involved with finance finance is a very boring field so maybe

119
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:58,860
I'm going to talk about finance and I tell you a little story about how I first got interested in this

120
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:03,100
and why it's important to me this field about money.

121
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:05,540
Some people some people think it's boring.

122
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:06,850
Some people think it's interesting.

123
00:07:06,870 --> 00:07:08,450
I think it can be interesting.

124
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:15,510
But if we first care about the story then we'll maybe start caring about finance maybe maybe about three

125
00:07:15,510 --> 00:07:25,650
years ago I went I went on a trip to Ethiopia and on that trip blah blah blah something happened.

126
00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:31,770
And that's the thing that maybe got me started on this big project that I'm doing whatever it happens

127
00:07:31,770 --> 00:07:32,220
to be.

128
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:32,790
OK.

129
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:34,290
So I start a little story.

130
00:07:34,290 --> 00:07:36,720
This is a great way to connect with your audience.

131
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,340
This is type 2.

132
00:07:38,370 --> 00:07:40,530
When it comes to making hooks.

133
00:07:40,530 --> 00:07:43,660
Now let's go on and talk about the last type of hook.

134
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:48,530
So the last type of hook is also a way to interact with the audience.

135
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:51,160
And I want to sort of connect these two points together.

136
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:57,300
I said I was going to talk about how you could interact with the audience and one way to do that is

137
00:07:57,300 --> 00:08:00,470
also a way to do a hook.

138
00:08:00,490 --> 00:08:03,180
This is to get a show of hands.

139
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:08,340
This is a little bit of what we would call audience participation.

140
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:12,600
Audience Power Dissipation you want to get the audience to do something.

141
00:08:12,630 --> 00:08:19,510
And by doing that by getting them to do something they're now part of your presentation.

142
00:08:19,550 --> 00:08:20,890
They're now with you.

143
00:08:21,010 --> 00:08:22,290
They're a piece of it.

144
00:08:22,290 --> 00:08:26,430
Before it was just you standing up there giving the presentation.

145
00:08:26,430 --> 00:08:32,160
Now it's you and them together in a way because they've done something to contribute to it and they

146
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:35,550
feel now a little bit maybe a little bit responsible for it.

147
00:08:35,730 --> 00:08:36,750
Oh I'm part of this thing.

148
00:08:36,930 --> 00:08:39,340
So how can we get people to put their hands up.

149
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:48,600
Well we can just say hands up after a question for example who here doesn't own a smartphone.

150
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:50,910
Hands up hands.

151
00:08:51,090 --> 00:08:52,660
Hands up.

152
00:08:52,650 --> 00:08:54,240
Who doesn't own a smartphone.

153
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:54,630
Hands up.

154
00:08:54,630 --> 00:08:56,370
This is not rhetorical.

155
00:08:56,370 --> 00:08:57,610
This is a real question.

156
00:08:57,750 --> 00:09:01,300
But I want the person who doesn't have one to put their hand up.

157
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:06,570
And so maybe I don't know if it's an audience of 200 people one or two people might not have a smartphone

158
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:07,380
maybe.

159
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:14,160
So two people put their hands up and I say you should always say something about the result because

160
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:18,800
you have the best perspective or view of the audience.

161
00:09:18,810 --> 00:09:24,330
I mean that physically I mean physically from where you're standing you can see the audience better

162
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:26,530
than anyone else.

163
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:28,670
So you have the best perspective.

164
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:29,040
OK.

165
00:09:29,070 --> 00:09:34,920
So we could say just by show of hands who here doesn't have a smartphone.

166
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:36,570
Two people put their hands up.

167
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:38,850
Oh that's what I thought.

168
00:09:38,910 --> 00:09:45,150
That's what I thought to people about to.

169
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:47,190
So my guess was about right.

170
00:09:47,190 --> 00:09:51,870
I guessed most people would not put their hands up because most people have a smartphone.

171
00:09:52,130 --> 00:09:52,650
OK.

172
00:09:52,710 --> 00:10:00,540
So you should report the results if it's about 50 percent you can say OK about about half of you half

173
00:10:00,630 --> 00:10:03,080
of you about half of you don't.

174
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:05,840
OK just by a show of hands.

175
00:10:05,850 --> 00:10:11,760
This is another expression just by a show of hands who here I know that doesn't look like it but that's

176
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:19,010
an R there who here would like to live to be more than 100 who here would like to live to be more than

177
00:10:19,010 --> 00:10:19,860
a hundred.

178
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:20,180
Oh wow.

179
00:10:20,210 --> 00:10:20,620
OK.

180
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:24,560
About a third of you would like to live to be more than 100.

181
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:24,860
OK.

182
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:27,510
So we can judge the results a little bit.

183
00:10:27,510 --> 00:10:35,100
Give everybody a feeling for their level of participation and then go on and talk about the actual thing

184
00:10:35,130 --> 00:10:38,090
whatever it is we're going to talk about.

185
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:44,000
So these are the three types of hooks that I think are the most useful and probably are the most common.

186
00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:45,910
Making it personal.

187
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:52,020
Asking for a show of hands and asking a rhetorical question if you know how to use these well you can

188
00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:53,390
always get your presentation.

189
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:55,770
Started off the right way.
