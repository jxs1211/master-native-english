1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:04,120
All right so let's start with the dos and don'ts of giving a presentation.

2
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:07,210
Now most presentations have what's called a.

3
00:00:07,510 --> 00:00:12,210
That's actually called a slide show but it's often called a PowerPoint.

4
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:15,180
It's often abbreviated as PBT.

5
00:00:15,270 --> 00:00:18,120
Let's just call it a PowerPoint or a PPD.

6
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:21,660
In this lesson even though that's actually not the real name.

7
00:00:21,690 --> 00:00:26,160
But anyway the dos and don'ts things we should do things we should avoid.

8
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:28,050
Let's start with the don'ts.

9
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:31,970
Well you don't want to write too much on the PPD.

10
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:37,930
If you write a lot on the PPE it's going to actually have less of an impact.

11
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:44,500
Now I'm writing a lot here but that's because you're coming along with me for each thing that I'm writing.

12
00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:47,210
You're sort of seeing me write most of it down.

13
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:50,870
So we're kind of exploring this space together.

14
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:58,980
But when you write a lot on each slide when you write a lot on each slide it actually makes the audience

15
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:01,920
go like that.

16
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:10,650
But if you just have a few key things very key important key means important things on the slide and

17
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:14,330
it's very easy to read and takes three seconds to read.

18
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:21,480
Then it's going to have much more impact and your ideas which you're explaining can then focus on those

19
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:27,180
points and you can have a visual reference to the things you're talking about.

20
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:31,940
That's actually what the PBT is usually for the words coming out of your mouth.

21
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:33,490
Those are the details.

22
00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:35,080
That's the explanation.

23
00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:39,600
Then the thing on the slide that's the the reference point.

24
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:43,180
That's the thing that keeps you focused on what's the topic again.

25
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:43,370
OK.

26
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:50,370
So remember the role of of that and also don't read it too much from the PBT maybe a little bit is OK.

27
00:01:50,370 --> 00:01:51,000
Sure.

28
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:58,290
But if you just turn around and say and in 1997 we had a blah blah blah blah blah and you read what

29
00:01:58,290 --> 00:01:59,410
it says.

30
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:06,990
That is a mistake generally speaking because you're dis connecting with the audience the audience the

31
00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:14,290
people you're talking to by turning around and because you're reading it's now much less engaging.

32
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:21,450
If for example I was reading a script for this course looking over there you could tell.

33
00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:24,630
And it would feel less engaging for you.

34
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:26,100
You would be less interested.

35
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:28,240
So be very careful about that.

36
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:34,650
You want to avoid reading too much and you certainly want to avoid turning around too much to actually

37
00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:37,180
face away from your audience.

38
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:41,820
Hey don't memorize every word do not memorize every word.

39
00:02:41,850 --> 00:02:48,960
For some reason a lot of people who do presentations feel like they have to memorize every word.

40
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:51,150
If you do that it's not a presentation.

41
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:52,740
It's called a speech.

42
00:02:52,770 --> 00:02:59,220
A speech is something that has to be so perfectly worded because you're the president or something or

43
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:06,930
a king that you can't make any mistakes and so you read it or you memorize it and say it when you're

44
00:03:06,930 --> 00:03:08,530
talking to people.

45
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:15,550
If you are memorizing every word it's basically the same as sitting there and reading in front of everybody.

46
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:22,400
In 1997 there was a terrible flood and it's not quite that serious but that's the idea.

47
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:27,230
People can tell but if you have clear points in your mind and you know what you're talking about.

48
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:32,340
But you don't have maybe all of the exact words then it feels natural.

49
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:38,790
It feels like real human communication which hopefully this feels like and I'm not planning every single

50
00:03:38,790 --> 00:03:43,030
word that I'm saying I'm speaking about a topic that I know about.

51
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:47,100
And watch TED talks if you haven't already I'm sure you have but.

52
00:03:47,450 --> 00:03:50,090
But Ted is Ted dot com.

53
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:58,530
There are many many great TED Talks and 95 percent of the great ones are not memorized.

54
00:03:58,650 --> 00:04:00,060
They're speaking about some points.

55
00:04:00,090 --> 00:04:00,310
OK.

56
00:04:00,330 --> 00:04:03,860
So avoid memorizing every word don't read.

57
00:04:03,990 --> 00:04:05,480
Must you really have to.

58
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:08,350
And don't write too much on your teeth.

59
00:04:08,370 --> 00:04:08,550
All right.

60
00:04:08,550 --> 00:04:09,480
Things you should do.

61
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:10,040
Number one.

62
00:04:10,050 --> 00:04:11,160
Be yourself.

63
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:18,750
Obviously if you try to make a fake personality when you're standing up in front of people Hello everyone

64
00:04:19,020 --> 00:04:24,560
or or whatever people can feel it OK just be yourself be natural.

65
00:04:24,690 --> 00:04:26,520
Speak as you speak.

66
00:04:26,530 --> 00:04:27,360
OK.

67
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:28,740
Speak to the audience.

68
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:34,520
Now this is kind of related to this one but no who is listening to you speak.

69
00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:41,620
If you're giving a presentation and there are a hundred thousand not too many say one hundred thousand

70
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:47,870
two thousand people two hundred people ten people four people.

71
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:51,060
Your presentation is going to be different if it's for people.

72
00:04:51,110 --> 00:04:53,900
Are you going to come out and say hello everyone.

73
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:55,510
No he won't do so.

74
00:04:55,550 --> 00:04:56,190
OK.

75
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:57,420
Four people up here.

76
00:04:57,570 --> 00:04:58,820
I'm glad you came.

77
00:04:58,820 --> 00:05:04,940
Why don't we sit at a table together and I'll talk through my points and then we can discuss OK.

78
00:05:05,030 --> 00:05:08,630
Or maybe you come out and it's a bunch of teenagers in high school.

79
00:05:08,630 --> 00:05:11,060
Well then you're going to speak differently.

80
00:05:11,150 --> 00:05:17,430
Know who you're talking to know your audience and speak to them.

81
00:05:17,450 --> 00:05:20,740
So every presentation will probably not be the same.

82
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:24,830
Different sizes of audiences different groups of people.

83
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:27,410
OK so you have to think about that when you come out.

84
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:32,440
When you start talking you really do speak to that specific group of people.

85
00:05:32,450 --> 00:05:32,830
OK.

86
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:34,280
Next engage.

87
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:35,300
Now this is obvious.

88
00:05:35,330 --> 00:05:37,350
This means you need to connect with people.

89
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:43,130
But if you just start talking and they have no reason the audience the people watching you they have

90
00:05:43,130 --> 00:05:44,500
no reason to care.

91
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:50,570
You don't give them a reason to care at the beginning especially then you've lost them for 15 minutes

92
00:05:50,570 --> 00:05:53,830
or however long your presentation is engage.

93
00:05:53,930 --> 00:05:55,600
Use a hook at the beginning.

94
00:05:55,610 --> 00:06:00,760
Find a way to make them care about you and your topic right at the beginning.

95
00:06:00,830 --> 00:06:05,680
Right when you start and if you do that then you're going to carry them along with you.

96
00:06:05,690 --> 00:06:12,380
And again if you go to Ted and watch TED talks you will see the good ones have something at the beginning

97
00:06:12,410 --> 00:06:18,030
that hooks you grabs you like a fish and you want to listen.

98
00:06:18,110 --> 00:06:20,740
This is so interesting why do I care about this.

99
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:24,950
I don't usually care about this topic but I care about it in this presentation.

100
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:25,460
Why.

101
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:28,610
Probably because there was a good hook at the beginning.
