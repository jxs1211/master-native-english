1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:00,480
All right.

2
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:06,570
So just to set the scene very quickly let's imagine there are 30 to 40 people in a relatively small

3
00:00:06,630 --> 00:00:07,200
place.

4
00:00:07,210 --> 00:00:08,490
There's a little stage.

5
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:13,330
I walk up on the stage I'm going to give my presentation about the value of travel.

6
00:00:13,350 --> 00:00:14,430
No slides.

7
00:00:14,430 --> 00:00:16,030
I'm just gonna go through my outline.

8
00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:17,270
But I could have slides.

9
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:18,180
I probably would.

10
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:20,490
This were a real situation.

11
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:20,700
OK.

12
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:29,090
So I walk up on stage just by show of hands who here thinks that travel is more than just a vacation.

13
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:29,680
Who here.

14
00:00:29,740 --> 00:00:35,370
OK so about half of you about half of you think that when you go on a trip you're getting more than

15
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:37,230
just relaxation.

16
00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:43,290
Today I want to talk about what I feel is the the actual value of travel and why traveling can really

17
00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:50,330
teach us new things open our minds and give us genuinely meaningful experiences.

18
00:00:50,380 --> 00:00:53,810
And the first thing really is is about where we get ideas.

19
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:59,100
Being exposed to new things is an extremely important part of travel.

20
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:01,400
Seeing things that you've never seen before.

21
00:01:01,470 --> 00:01:05,660
But for example when I first went abroad I actually traveled to India.

22
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:07,950
I'd never travel abroad before.

23
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:12,720
And India is a very different country than the United States where I'm from.

24
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:15,150
So I plan to study study yoga.

25
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:24,150
I went over to India and it was just so different the smells the sights the sounds the language everything

26
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:26,660
was just so different that it shocked me at first.

27
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:34,650
I was in a state of shock but after a day or two when it started to become comfortable all those sites

28
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:40,530
and smells and sounds began to get comfortable and I became curious about each one.

29
00:01:40,750 --> 00:01:47,400
And by speaking to local people I was able to learn about what people thought and I learned that what

30
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:52,170
people thought was different than what I thought my opinions and their opinions were different and that

31
00:01:52,260 --> 00:01:57,240
I realized is the beautiful thing about being human that we're all different.

32
00:01:57,270 --> 00:02:03,330
We have our own viewpoints and each viewpoint is unique and really interesting in its own way.

33
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:09,300
Now another important part for me about travel is experiencing food and of course when I was in India

34
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:14,330
I was able to explore a lot of different cuisines that I had never imagined before.

35
00:02:14,370 --> 00:02:22,890
I cannot tell you how important it has been for me to be able to experience all of the different cuisines

36
00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:31,370
that I've tried in my life whether it's in China Thailand India other parts of Asia Europe Africa even.

37
00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:38,070
And now that I'm back in the U.S. and not really traveling so much that's become part of who I am because

38
00:02:38,070 --> 00:02:43,950
I've been opened up to the possibilities of cuisine and food.

39
00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:45,590
Now I feel like I need it.

40
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:46,730
It's part of me.

41
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:48,350
So I have to go out here.

42
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:49,580
I live in New York.

43
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:54,690
I have to go out every week and find Chinese food one day Ethiopian food the next Indian food the next

44
00:02:54,690 --> 00:02:55,860
Mexican food the next.

45
00:02:55,990 --> 00:02:57,570
It's part of me now.

46
00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:00,620
It's an it and it's an incredibly valuable part of myself.

47
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:08,220
Now beyond just gaining new insights into how other people think into other cultures really broadening

48
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:16,920
our minds whether it's religion or for example how people eat food exploring cuisine travel also gives

49
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:24,750
us the opportunity to step out of the grind the daily routine and when we do that a couple of things

50
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:25,770
happen.

51
00:03:25,770 --> 00:03:30,960
One is that we start to see our own routine differently.

52
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:38,550
Whenever I travel somewhere and I'm gone for a while and I come back everything that I thought was boring

53
00:03:38,910 --> 00:03:45,060
before I left is suddenly new and fresh and I begin to appreciate the details of my normal life even

54
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:46,250
more.

55
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:49,100
For example I often travel to China when I come back.

56
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:55,350
I think I'm in New York New York is cool little interesting food we have here all my cats are here my

57
00:03:55,350 --> 00:03:57,620
cats are wonderful my wonderful wife is here.

58
00:03:57,630 --> 00:04:00,940
This is all great but sometimes sometimes.

59
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:07,410
Before I leave when I've been doing the same thing day after day it can begin to lose appreciation for

60
00:04:07,410 --> 00:04:14,140
that but also when you actually go somewhere else you're somewhere new or somewhere you've never been.

61
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:21,960
That as I mentioned culture shock can immediately put you into another state of mind another frame of

62
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:22,640
mind.

63
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,590
And that's where inspiration happens.

64
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:30,840
I found many of my best ideas when I've been thrown into unexpected situations when something I didn't

65
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:32,790
expect to happen happened.

66
00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:36,300
And when you're traveling everything that happens is generally unexpected.

67
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:42,060
You might encounter someone new you might see a mountain and it's so beautiful that you get an idea

68
00:04:42,390 --> 00:04:44,140
or you appreciate nature differently.

69
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:51,690
It's getting out of the routine that often shocks us into new insights and new appreciation for the

70
00:04:51,690 --> 00:04:52,920
world around us.

71
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:59,490
I think it's a beautiful thing and I think that's often where a lot of the value of travel is missed

72
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:05,420
and people don't really think about it when they are on a very relaxing vacation and they're sitting

73
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:08,090
by the pool doing nothing.

74
00:05:08,090 --> 00:05:13,670
There's nothing wrong with that but when you're when you're out of the routine and you're exploring

75
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:16,150
you can see things differently.

76
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:18,200
And on top of both of those things.

77
00:05:19,030 --> 00:05:23,950
Just travelling and meeting people is extremely valuable in itself.

78
00:05:23,950 --> 00:05:29,530
At the very least travel is a fantastic way to build a global network.

79
00:05:29,530 --> 00:05:30,420
I mean think about it.

80
00:05:30,790 --> 00:05:35,860
If you meet people and make friends in countries around the world even in your own country different

81
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:40,360
places around your own country you're going to expand your network.

82
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:45,190
And that doesn't mean you should take advantage of people but it means more possibilities open up for

83
00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:47,020
you in the future.

84
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:53,440
So for example I went to Japan with my friend who I'd met on another trip living in Japan said to me

85
00:05:53,470 --> 00:05:55,290
Hey you're coming to Japan.

86
00:05:55,510 --> 00:05:58,700
Well you can just stay with me I'll take you around the city.

87
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:01,690
So I stayed with that person for a week.

88
00:06:01,690 --> 00:06:02,790
He took me around the city.

89
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,680
We had a lot of fun together.

90
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:11,380
And then that same person came to visit me in my home stayed with me in my home and I took him around

91
00:06:11,710 --> 00:06:12,540
my city.

92
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:18,520
And that kind of exchange is beautiful because you deepen relationships but you also then can get for

93
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:23,480
example a deeper look into the local area because they know it better.

94
00:06:23,530 --> 00:06:29,500
If you're by yourself traveling well you know you can read a tour book but the person who lives there

95
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:31,750
is is going to know much more about it.

96
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:36,030
The best places to eat the best places to visit the best places to have fun.

97
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:38,950
They're going to do a lot more about the local place.

98
00:06:38,950 --> 00:06:45,040
Now from personal experience I would recommend when you travel stay in places like bed and breakfasts

99
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:51,880
or maybe even hostels because you have the opportunity to meet other travelers and you might then have

100
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:54,970
experiences that you never expected to have.

101
00:06:54,970 --> 00:07:01,300
I once was staying at a hostel and met a couple of girls and they were kind of afraid to go out because

102
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:02,390
it was getting dark.

103
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:05,490
And I said Oh well I can I can go out with you.

104
00:07:05,590 --> 00:07:07,420
And so they felt safe to go out with me.

105
00:07:07,570 --> 00:07:12,970
And because of that we ended up having this crazy adventure the next day actually where we went to the

106
00:07:12,970 --> 00:07:17,430
zoo and I would never have done that if I hadn't.

107
00:07:17,530 --> 00:07:22,730
That very interesting experience I would have never had that experience had I not met them.

108
00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:25,870
I might have I don't know gone to a coffee shop and done some work.

109
00:07:25,870 --> 00:07:27,520
It would have been very boring.

110
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:28,170
Right.

111
00:07:28,210 --> 00:07:32,460
So the unexpected things often come when we meet new people.

112
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:35,240
Those new people can get us out of our shell.

113
00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:41,340
So the next time you're planning a trip don't book a five star hotel.

114
00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:43,720
Don't stay by yourself and sit by the pool and read.

115
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:45,520
That's fine to do sometimes.

116
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:53,410
Next time why don't you try to have an adventure go somewhere crazy stay at a weird bed and breakfast

117
00:07:53,770 --> 00:07:56,380
make new friends do something you've never done.

118
00:07:56,380 --> 00:07:57,580
Try new food.

119
00:07:57,580 --> 00:08:03,930
You're going to have experiences that are going to stick with you for the rest of your life.

120
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:05,590
Thank you very much.

121
00:08:05,590 --> 00:08:05,890
All right.

122
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:12,580
So we've covered how to give a presentation the dos and don'ts talked about how to engage and how to

123
00:08:12,580 --> 00:08:13,960
make a hook.

124
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:16,510
We've talked about how to make an outline very important.

125
00:08:16,510 --> 00:08:23,320
And I've given you an example presentation that I did not prepare before that I gave directly from my

126
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:28,030
outline as a test to see how good my outline was.

127
00:08:28,030 --> 00:08:29,050
And you can do it too.

128
00:08:29,140 --> 00:08:30,220
Doesn't have to be perfect.

129
00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:35,530
Mine wasn't perfect but if you do this more and more and you get used to it it gets more and more comfortable.

130
00:08:35,530 --> 00:08:40,800
So when you need to give a real presentation and you have two weeks to prepare it's going to be easy.

131
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:46,420
You can spend your time looking for cool pictures for your team instead of worrying about what to talk

132
00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:49,270
about because the outline part is not that hard.

133
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:55,840
So to practice this I'd like you to choose a topic like travel life lesson you've learned the value

134
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:58,030
of choosing your major in university.

135
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:05,860
Then create an outline just like we did in this lesson and then give your presentation recorded or give

136
00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:11,350
your presentation to a friend and recorded listen to it again and get feedback from from your friend

137
00:09:11,370 --> 00:09:13,310
or you can get a group of friends.

138
00:09:13,330 --> 00:09:16,650
Even better practice this if you get good at this.

139
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:17,160
Wow.

140
00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:22,240
If you can get good at giving presentations and making outlines you are powerful.

141
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:22,720
Good luck.
