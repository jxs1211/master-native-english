1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:02,790
Please listen to this part really carefully.

2
00:00:02,850 --> 00:00:10,440
If you're good at organizing your thoughts whether in your mind or on paper it's going to be a lot easier

3
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:17,260
for you to speak clearly if you're trying very hard to think about what to say and how to say it.

4
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:23,560
And you know the pronunciation and all that stuff it's going to be really hard for you to express yourself

5
00:00:23,590 --> 00:00:24,230
clearly.

6
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:29,770
You're probably going to make a lot more mistakes because you're going to exceed your bandwidth your

7
00:00:29,770 --> 00:00:31,670
ability to focus on everything.

8
00:00:31,870 --> 00:00:37,870
But if you're able to organize your thoughts at the very least on paper everything gets a lot easier

9
00:00:38,350 --> 00:00:39,690
when you're doing a presentation.

10
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:42,310
The outline is so important.

11
00:00:42,310 --> 00:00:50,290
If if you make a clear outline and you really get the ideas you really feel the ideas you have your

12
00:00:50,380 --> 00:00:52,920
mind around the ideas in the outline.

13
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:54,310
All you have to do is go through it.

14
00:00:54,310 --> 00:00:55,570
One two three four five.

15
00:00:56,140 --> 00:00:57,310
It's easy.

16
00:00:57,340 --> 00:01:03,030
So in this part of the lesson we're going to talk about how to make an outline.

17
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:09,640
We're going to make one together and then we're going to actually after this do a presentation I'm going

18
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:16,210
to do a presentation based on the outline just to be clear the outline is the basic structure.

19
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:21,080
The a done be done done see that.

20
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:26,720
That tells you what to say next and then and then and then and then it's nothing more than that.

21
00:01:26,770 --> 00:01:31,750
If you write down all of the words you want to say in your outline it's not really an outline anymore.

22
00:01:31,750 --> 00:01:37,870
It's more like a script and it's going to be really hard to read through and you're going to get confused.

23
00:01:37,930 --> 00:01:39,460
It's truly going to be a mess.

24
00:01:39,550 --> 00:01:41,130
So keep it really simple.

25
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:49,180
I try to keep outlines to just a couple words really like a skeleton a basic basic structure that reminds

26
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:51,120
me of what to talk about next.

27
00:01:51,190 --> 00:01:56,200
Then I let the words come out of my mouth as they would like to pretty much.

28
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:56,860
I mean I try to.

29
00:01:57,100 --> 00:02:01,630
I try to say things clearly but I'm not too focused on what what should I talk about next.

30
00:02:01,630 --> 00:02:03,720
And that makes things a lot easier.

31
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:04,930
So keep it simple.

32
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:06,220
And that will help you a lot too.

33
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:07,340
Let's actually do it.

34
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:14,230
Our topic will be the value of travel the value of travel.

35
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:16,280
Yes that will be our topic.

36
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:18,790
That's more than just by the way travel itself.

37
00:02:18,790 --> 00:02:21,670
But why is travel something that's actually important.

38
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:23,090
That's what I want to talk about.

39
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:26,860
Now what's my hook kind of hook do I want to use.

40
00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:29,010
Let's let's just go with something very basic.

41
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:35,050
By the way go with if I haven't explained that before I often say that go with means choose let's go

42
00:02:35,050 --> 00:02:38,250
with something very basic very simple very basic.

43
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:41,240
Let's just ask for a show of hands for our hook.

44
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:42,170
Keep it simple.

45
00:02:42,170 --> 00:02:42,770
OK.

46
00:02:42,790 --> 00:02:45,640
And I'm gonna write down the hook because it's so short.

47
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:47,030
Who here.

48
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:54,550
Who here sees travel as as more than just a vacation.

49
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:55,220
Hands up.

50
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:55,490
OK.

51
00:02:55,510 --> 00:02:58,250
So that's one of the hooks that we talked about earlier.

52
00:02:58,270 --> 00:03:03,670
Just one of the hooks hands up one the interaction one of course we could do a rhetorical question if

53
00:03:03,670 --> 00:03:04,770
we wanted to.

54
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:09,160
Have you ever been on a trip and had a really profound experience.

55
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:16,530
I'd like you to think about that experience as I begin my presentation that one time.

56
00:03:17,270 --> 00:03:17,960
OK.

57
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:23,320
So I'm going to use this one just because it's so simple and I am going to write it down only because

58
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:24,310
it's so short.

59
00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:29,960
Normally as long as you have the basic idea of it in your mind that is totally fine.

60
00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:31,570
Now how about the introduction.

61
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:33,020
What about the introduction.

62
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,930
Do we always need an introduction.

63
00:03:34,930 --> 00:03:37,450
Well I like to do something really simple.

64
00:03:37,450 --> 00:03:47,070
I usually just say today today I would or I'd like to share with you.

65
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:50,110
I usually say something like this today I'd like to share with you.

66
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:57,700
It's just a way to say hey this is my topic after my hook so I'll give my hook first and then I'll give

67
00:03:57,700 --> 00:04:03,940
my basic basic introduction doesn't have to be anything too long or too serious pretty simple.

68
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:07,150
Then we get into the actual outline itself.

69
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:16,340
So let's break down and build together the outline of our presentation on the value of travel.

70
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:23,170
My basic structure for doing an outline is a there's going to be a point here then.

71
00:04:23,170 --> 00:04:26,650
Example example or detailed detail B.

72
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:28,300
The main point here.

73
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:30,740
Second main point example here.

74
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:36,290
Detail here could be an example or a specific detail about it depending on the topic.

75
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:40,080
Then sometimes not always see main point.

76
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:43,570
Example example for example detail or whatever.

77
00:04:43,570 --> 00:04:50,640
And then so comma and I'll say one last thing and there are many ways to do that.

78
00:04:50,650 --> 00:04:55,660
You don't have to use so I generally like to use so when I'm doing a presentation.

79
00:04:55,660 --> 00:05:02,110
So this is our basic our basic structure and of course here we have our of course our basic hook and

80
00:05:02,110 --> 00:05:13,680
our intro so hook Intro A B C so at the very end a exposure to new ideas exposure to new ideas.

81
00:05:13,690 --> 00:05:13,920
All right.

82
00:05:13,930 --> 00:05:15,130
That's a good one.

83
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:15,820
Let's see.

84
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:17,180
Example number one.

85
00:05:17,190 --> 00:05:17,740
Oh OK.

86
00:05:17,770 --> 00:05:25,070
Trip to India then I'm gonna write shock here to remind myself to talk about the sort of culture shock

87
00:05:25,190 --> 00:05:28,730
of going to India for the first time very different than America.

88
00:05:28,790 --> 00:05:30,000
Good experience.

89
00:05:30,050 --> 00:05:32,080
Next let's see.

90
00:05:32,270 --> 00:05:35,580
Eating traditions eating traditions.

91
00:05:35,730 --> 00:05:40,760
OK I'm just gonna write eating traditions because I know what I want to share when I talk about eating

92
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:41,350
traditions.

93
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:46,450
I have something in my head but this helps me remember what I'm going to talk about.

94
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:53,780
I'm going to talk about how on my many trips I like to sample local food especially street food because

95
00:05:53,780 --> 00:05:58,970
then I feel like I can get a deep feeling for the history of each place.

96
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:03,890
I'm going to talk about that but I'm just going to use eating traditions to help me remember what I'm

97
00:06:03,890 --> 00:06:04,960
going to talk about.

98
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:05,500
All right.

99
00:06:05,630 --> 00:06:10,400
So this is part A the main idea why is travel valuable.

100
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:18,260
Well because you get exposure that means you get to see new ideas and that makes you reflect and think

101
00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:21,420
about who you are where you come from be.

102
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:23,070
Get get.

103
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:24,230
Oh no let's not use get.

104
00:06:24,230 --> 00:06:25,630
I want to make it even shorter.

105
00:06:25,670 --> 00:06:27,650
A break from routine.

106
00:06:28,010 --> 00:06:33,050
So for this one I'm going to talk about why it's so important to not do the same thing every day and

107
00:06:33,050 --> 00:06:39,830
how travel can really break you out of doing the same thing and give you a lot of new fresh ideas and

108
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:42,620
improve the quality of of your life.

109
00:06:42,650 --> 00:06:47,530
Explore inner self who you are on the inside.

110
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:49,490
And I'm going to give a detail on that.

111
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:52,240
The next one I want to really make it pretty short.

112
00:06:52,250 --> 00:07:01,190
I'm gonna write normal life fresh eyes and then I'm going to talk about how when you come back from

113
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:06,680
traveling for maybe two weeks or even a month when you come back to your own life you can appreciate

114
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:08,410
it in a totally new way.

115
00:07:08,450 --> 00:07:13,760
You realize that it is maybe interesting you can see the value in it whereas before when you left you

116
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:16,920
are sick and tired and everything was dumb and boring.

117
00:07:16,970 --> 00:07:22,820
I want to talk about that now see let's do global network again.

118
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:25,030
We're talking about the value of travel.

119
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:32,600
We have three main ideas one is about exposing yourself to new ideas and new ways of life and the value

120
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:33,910
of that be.

121
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:37,570
Point being number two is about breaking away out of your normal routine.

122
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:43,190
Why that's so important to do and then see is about your Global Network who you know around the world.

123
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:44,990
And I'm gonna give an example.

124
00:07:44,990 --> 00:07:48,580
Staying in Japan I know what that means.

125
00:07:48,590 --> 00:07:50,070
I have a little story for that.

126
00:07:50,090 --> 00:07:51,520
Your outline is for you.

127
00:07:51,530 --> 00:07:53,570
You don't have to show it to everybody else.

128
00:07:53,630 --> 00:07:56,960
I'm showing it to you because I'm showing you the process for making it.

129
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:59,510
It's so easy but it really it's for me.

130
00:07:59,510 --> 00:08:04,130
It reminds me of the story I want to talk about my example of staying in Japan.

131
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:11,660
Then I'm going to say unexpected adventures unexpected adventures and then I'm going to talk about how

132
00:08:12,050 --> 00:08:17,690
when I meet people when I am traveling I think maybe oh I'm going to go to this place I'm going to visit

133
00:08:17,690 --> 00:08:18,710
this this and this.

134
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:24,230
But I end up meeting people and we do things together and that makes the experience much more interesting.

135
00:08:24,230 --> 00:08:30,500
I have a deeper experience and a deeper appreciation for the place I'm visiting because I've met people

136
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:36,610
and my my growing network is making my travels more valuable all the time.

137
00:08:36,710 --> 00:08:44,550
So next time you're planning that's my beginning I'm gonna say planning a trip just helps me remember.

138
00:08:44,570 --> 00:08:44,800
All right.

139
00:08:44,810 --> 00:08:48,830
So let's just review this a exposure to new ideas.

140
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:54,600
Talk about my trip to India and the culture shock me that I'm going to talk about eating traditions.

141
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:59,650
OK so those are new things that are adding value b get away from my normal life.

142
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:07,010
Get out of my routine and learn more about myself but also when I come back see my own life with fresh

143
00:09:07,010 --> 00:09:15,230
eyes see my network around the world and stay with my friend in Japan for example and unexpected adventures

144
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:18,710
valuable experiences that I never planned to have.

145
00:09:18,710 --> 00:09:26,810
So next time you plan or you're planning a trip I'm going to talk about how if you stay in a hotel by

146
00:09:26,810 --> 00:09:28,610
yourself it's probably not good.

147
00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:35,810
So next time you're planning a trip don't stay in a five star resort a resort is a resort is a very

148
00:09:35,810 --> 00:09:36,730
nice place.

149
00:09:36,770 --> 00:09:38,050
Of course it's good to do that.

150
00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:39,780
If you really just want to relax.

151
00:09:39,830 --> 00:09:45,230
But if you really want to meet people maybe go out and explore the local area.

152
00:09:45,290 --> 00:09:45,570
All right.

153
00:09:45,590 --> 00:09:49,010
So I've got my ideas down I'm going to do my presentation.

154
00:09:49,010 --> 00:09:51,880
This is a promise I'm going to do my presentation.

155
00:09:51,980 --> 00:09:55,790
One time I have not prepared this presentation before.

156
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:58,400
I have not given this presentation before.

157
00:09:58,430 --> 00:09:59,660
This is real.

158
00:09:59,670 --> 00:10:03,200
OK I might cut little pieces to make it shorter.

159
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:10,340
If if I need to just to save you some time watching but I'm only going to do this presentation one time

160
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:15,890
I want it to come across as natural I want it to be natural because I want to show you that you can

161
00:10:15,890 --> 00:10:21,440
make an outline and then do the presentation five minutes later it's not a big deal.

162
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:27,650
People get this big idea about well I got to work on my presentation for weeks and I guess if you have

163
00:10:27,650 --> 00:10:31,900
to prepare all of the slides and pictures in your PPE that's true.

164
00:10:32,210 --> 00:10:38,420
But the basic ideas in your presentation you can get down in a simple outline and you could give the
