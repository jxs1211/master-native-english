1
00:00:04,020 --> 00:00:09,990
In the last lesson we went over some of the basics quanta fires to make sure that when we're speaking

2
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:17,240
either casually or in a more formal situation we don't make those basic mistakes.

3
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:22,830
Now we're going to go on in this lesson to something a bit more difficult something that a lot of people

4
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:29,220
even native English speakers are really afraid of making a presentation giving a presentation talking

5
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:31,440
in front of others about something.

6
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:34,330
Basically that's what a presentation is.

7
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:37,660
This is not just about the basics of doing a presentation.

8
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:40,280
We're actually going to build one together.

9
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:45,210
I'm going to show you how to build a presentation build an outline and then how to give it.

10
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:47,560
We're also going to talk about some dos and don'ts.

11
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:53,490
Basically things you should avoid and things you should make sure to remember when you're giving a presentation

12
00:00:53,790 --> 00:00:56,300
and we're going to focus on hooks.

13
00:00:56,310 --> 00:01:00,810
How to make your audience get interested in you and your topic.

14
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:06,120
Right from the very beginning we're also going to talk about how to interact with the audience when

15
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:08,250
you need to the end of the lesson.

16
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:13,470
I'm going to give a presentation based on the outline that we build in this lesson.

17
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:14,960
So we have a lot to do.

18
00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:16,290
Let's begin.
