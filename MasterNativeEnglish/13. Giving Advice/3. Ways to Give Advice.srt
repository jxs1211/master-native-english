1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:04,140
Now there are lots of different ways to give advice.

2
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:07,350
We've talked about some ways to ask for advice.

3
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:10,820
There are many many more ways to give advice.

4
00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:17,220
So let's go over some of the common phrases we can use to do it and we'll start with a really really

5
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:18,330
basic stuff.

6
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:22,790
And I'm guessing that you probably already know most of these.

7
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:30,270
So you can you can it is is soft so we'll talk about different levels of strength.

8
00:00:30,270 --> 00:00:32,430
If you say you could or you can.

9
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:35,680
Sometimes we use could to recommend what people do.

10
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:37,280
It's like we're putting it up there.

11
00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:45,240
But if the other person doesn't follow it it's OK it's OK so you can try and maybe running three days

12
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:47,240
a week if you want to lose weight.

13
00:00:47,310 --> 00:00:51,840
You could try running four or five days a week if you want to lose weight.

14
00:00:52,130 --> 00:00:54,560
OK that is a suggestion for what to do.

15
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:56,760
That's advice but it's very soft.

16
00:00:56,760 --> 00:01:00,120
That means it's not too pushy not too pushy.

17
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:02,040
Whereas if you say you should.

18
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:05,340
That is much more pushy much pushy here.

19
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:06,610
OK you should.

20
00:01:06,660 --> 00:01:12,410
It's almost as though if you don't do that I will be personally disappointed.

21
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:14,730
This is how should is often used.

22
00:01:14,730 --> 00:01:17,880
So these two basically are the same.

23
00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:22,680
It's just that the feeling is different that the level of pushing this is different.

24
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:24,090
The strength is different.

25
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:29,310
Now we can also recommend using questions and these are both pretty common.

26
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:33,000
Why don't you Why don't you just quit.

27
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:33,810
Why don't you just quit.

28
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:34,850
It's a question though.

29
00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:38,610
So if you're having a difficult time at your job.

30
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,530
My bad boss whatever.

31
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:42,690
Why don't you just quit and get a new job.

32
00:01:42,690 --> 00:01:44,370
That's very common advice.

33
00:01:44,370 --> 00:01:46,430
And maybe that's the best advice.

34
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:49,810
I'm not recommending you do that if you don't like your job.

35
00:01:49,830 --> 00:01:52,110
I don't know the whole situation OK.

36
00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:55,800
Or we could say how about How about you just quit.

37
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:57,170
How about you just quit.

38
00:01:57,180 --> 00:02:07,320
How about How about just breaking up with him or her or if you're with a girlfriend or boyfriend who

39
00:02:07,410 --> 00:02:14,520
is not the right fit for you and you're depressed or unhappy for whatever reason then your friend might

40
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:15,810
give you that advice.

41
00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:18,600
How about or why don't you pretty much the same.

42
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:22,890
How about why don't you just break up with him just break up with her.

43
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:24,710
You're not the right match.

44
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:25,790
That's OK.

45
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:26,750
Move on.

46
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:28,630
Move on move on.

47
00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:32,890
You can use that for the job situation or the girlfriend boyfriend situation.

48
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:36,350
Maybe it's time to move on.

49
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:42,100
That means to take the next step in your life either for work or for personal stuff.

50
00:02:42,110 --> 00:02:45,840
It can be used in lots of different lots of different situations.

51
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:46,270
OK.

52
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:52,210
So these are all really common using questions to give advice or using these simple phrases you can

53
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:53,010
you should.

54
00:02:53,010 --> 00:02:53,920
I left out.

55
00:02:53,970 --> 00:02:55,050
You ought to.

56
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:59,510
So you've probably seen you ought to in American English.

57
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:02,260
It's just not that common anymore.

58
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:04,560
People don't use it that often.

59
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,780
So you could use that ought to.

60
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:11,580
But I think it's more common to say you can you could and you should.

61
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:12,540
Much more common.

62
00:03:12,570 --> 00:03:19,770
Now we get into some ways to give advice which are a little bit more complicated than the ones we just

63
00:03:19,770 --> 00:03:20,430
talked about.

64
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:26,060
So let's go through them one by one and I'll explain how we can use each of them.

65
00:03:26,070 --> 00:03:26,680
OK.

66
00:03:26,730 --> 00:03:34,680
Now this is a very common style of expression in English anyway were and would always remember that

67
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:40,520
were and would usually go together to create something that's not real.

68
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,720
And we've talked about that before.

69
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:49,660
It's a hypothetical hypothetical very small hypothetical is something that we imagine OK.

70
00:03:49,770 --> 00:03:51,680
If I were you I would.

71
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:59,490
It's a very useful way to give advice because we're putting our selves in the shoes of the person we're

72
00:03:59,490 --> 00:04:03,180
giving advice to to show them that we empathize with them.

73
00:04:03,210 --> 00:04:09,150
So when we empathize when we empathize we show the other person that we understand their situation.

74
00:04:09,210 --> 00:04:17,940
We can say put yourself in my shoes or I will put myself in your shoes or in her shoes in his shoes.

75
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:20,400
Try to understand their situation.

76
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:26,000
So this is a really useful one because it shows that if I were you I would just move on.

77
00:04:26,010 --> 00:04:29,340
Maybe it's time to quit and find a new job.

78
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:32,300
If I were you I would just move on.

79
00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:38,880
This is probably my favorite way and one of the most common ways to give advice.

80
00:04:38,910 --> 00:04:39,210
OK.

81
00:04:39,210 --> 00:04:41,040
We can also use wood in this way.

82
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:43,640
I would wood just to make it softer.

83
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:46,770
You couldn't just say I suggest that you could say.

84
00:04:46,830 --> 00:04:50,420
I would suggest that you just find a new job.

85
00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:52,970
Take your career to the next level.

86
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,150
Move on.

87
00:04:54,150 --> 00:05:02,020
I would suggest that you move on and we use wood to make it a little soft it just doesn't really have

88
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:08,290
a very very clear meaning or use in the sentence but it does make it a little bit more indirect and

89
00:05:08,290 --> 00:05:12,370
it kind of takes some of the focus off what we're saying.

90
00:05:12,370 --> 00:05:14,300
We often use just in that way.

91
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:16,310
Oh just three miles.

92
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:17,600
How far did you run.

93
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:23,890
Just five miles to try to take some focus off of how many miles that is to try to make it seem like

94
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:25,540
it's not a big deal.

95
00:05:25,650 --> 00:05:26,210
OK.

96
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:28,050
This is also very common.

97
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:35,950
Another way we can show empathy or empathize with the person who's asking us for advice is to use whenever

98
00:05:36,010 --> 00:05:36,720
I.

99
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:44,710
And then share a story about something that you experienced in the past which is very similar or exactly

100
00:05:44,710 --> 00:05:45,680
the same.

101
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:49,820
So let's say someone is asking for advice because they feel homesick.

102
00:05:49,930 --> 00:05:57,040
You know you're in college and your roommate is always talking about oh I miss my mom I miss my dad

103
00:05:57,040 --> 00:06:00,200
it's terrible I'm so homesick.

104
00:06:00,490 --> 00:06:01,480
They miss their home.

105
00:06:01,510 --> 00:06:02,920
That's what homesick means.

106
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:08,110
Whenever I feel homesick I just go out with some friends have a cup of coffee.

107
00:06:08,110 --> 00:06:13,600
Have a great conversation and it helps to distract me from how I feel.

108
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:16,720
Try that whenever I feel homesick.

109
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,190
I always.

110
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:19,900
So then we say what we do.

111
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:25,120
Whenever I feel homesick I usually give my parents a call.

112
00:06:25,150 --> 00:06:25,990
Call them on the phone.

113
00:06:25,990 --> 00:06:27,320
Talk to them for a while.

114
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:33,480
Whenever I feel homesick I may just take a quick trip home for the weekend and then come back.

115
00:06:33,530 --> 00:06:36,160
Always feeling much much better.

116
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:43,390
So we're trying to use our own experience to help other people which is a very obviously good way to

117
00:06:43,390 --> 00:06:48,520
share advice because you can show them that it works hey it worked for me.

118
00:06:48,610 --> 00:06:50,680
It's probably going to work for you too.

119
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:51,900
It works.

120
00:06:51,910 --> 00:06:53,380
It works.

121
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:55,720
Something works that means it's successful.

122
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:56,830
It's effective.

123
00:06:56,830 --> 00:06:57,820
It's effective.

124
00:06:57,820 --> 00:06:58,880
It's effective.

125
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:02,670
And because you're sharing that real example you're showing that it's effective.

126
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:07,380
You're not just throwing out some idea using your own life experience.

127
00:07:07,390 --> 00:07:14,230
OK now sometimes we want to give two pieces of advice or two bits of advice at the same time and that's

128
00:07:14,230 --> 00:07:21,700
a really good thing because sometimes there's obvious advice there's obvious advice and we'll talk more

129
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:24,540
about that word in a second if something is obvious.

130
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:27,730
You probably already know that right.

131
00:07:27,730 --> 00:07:32,230
Probably already know you can call your parents probably.

132
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:32,500
OK.

133
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:33,780
That's pretty obvious.

134
00:07:33,790 --> 00:07:40,570
So you can give two different bits in a row and that might help you move the conversation forward a

135
00:07:40,570 --> 00:07:42,280
little more quickly first.

136
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:50,200
You can give your parents a call and if that doesn't work that means if giving your parents a call is

137
00:07:50,470 --> 00:08:00,610
not successful not successful the next step would be for you to for example face time them or do a video

138
00:08:00,610 --> 00:08:06,100
call or hang out with friends more or go home for a visit.

139
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:06,610
OK.

140
00:08:06,730 --> 00:08:13,330
First you can call your parents and if that doesn't work drive home or take the bus home visit them

141
00:08:13,330 --> 00:08:17,140
for a weekend and then come back you will feel better to bits.

142
00:08:17,140 --> 00:08:18,090
That's very good.

143
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:23,650
The next one is also to get rid of the obvious the obvious bit of advice.

144
00:08:23,650 --> 00:08:31,120
The obvious piece of advice so that you can go to the real stuff because it's so obvious that you should

145
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:34,390
call your parents if you haven't tried that yet.

146
00:08:34,570 --> 00:08:38,050
Maybe you're not the smartest tool in the shed.

147
00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:39,780
So have you ever.

148
00:08:39,950 --> 00:08:41,200
Wait I can take this out.

149
00:08:41,230 --> 00:08:41,650
All right.

150
00:08:41,710 --> 00:08:42,740
Have you ever tried.

151
00:08:42,850 --> 00:08:47,230
We can use this in some situations but for the home sickness one it doesn't quite work.

152
00:08:47,710 --> 00:08:48,990
I feel so homesick.

153
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:49,750
What should I do.

154
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:51,290
I really need some advice.

155
00:08:51,310 --> 00:08:52,780
Could you give me some advice.

156
00:08:52,780 --> 00:08:55,470
Have you tried calling your parents.

157
00:08:55,630 --> 00:08:57,940
Have you tried calling your parents.

158
00:08:58,330 --> 00:08:59,620
Yeah I tried that.

159
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:04,140
OK well now you can and then you can give more advice.

160
00:09:04,150 --> 00:09:10,360
Oh if you already tried that you already did that go home for the weekend visit.

161
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:18,140
Or maybe get on Facebook and check some old photos or chat with them online.

162
00:09:18,210 --> 00:09:19,650
Whatever advice you want to give.

163
00:09:19,710 --> 00:09:21,140
Now when can we use.

164
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:22,530
I had ever here before.

165
00:09:22,530 --> 00:09:23,830
When can we use ever.

166
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:25,600
Have you ever tried that.

167
00:09:25,650 --> 00:09:30,480
This would be for a much larger thing that we're giving advice about.

168
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:35,600
So I've maybe tried to quit smoking many many times and failed.

169
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:36,480
I'm trying again.

170
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:37,450
Well have you ever.

171
00:09:37,470 --> 00:09:44,940
Have you ever tried using one of those patches little patch people put on their arms to quit smoking.

172
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:51,270
Have you ever tried using one of those patches to ever kind of focuses on something that is a larger

173
00:09:51,270 --> 00:09:53,490
scale in your whole life.

174
00:09:53,490 --> 00:09:54,950
Have you tried this.

175
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:56,890
That's when we usually use ever.

176
00:09:56,970 --> 00:09:58,470
Have you ever done that.

177
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:00,340
Have you ever been to Canada.

178
00:10:00,390 --> 00:10:06,600
Have you ever tried using those patches so it would be for that kind of advice which is something that

179
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:11,050
maybe happens over a lifetime or over several years.

180
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:15,850
The homesick example is kind of a right now type of advice.

181
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:21,750
OK so these are all really common ways these are a little bit more complicated but they're also a little

182
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:26,820
bit more specific and I think they're very very effective ways to give advice.

183
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:33,450
And if you're using the first two whenever I and I would suggest and if I were you able to show the

184
00:10:33,450 --> 00:10:36,510
other person that you actually care about them.
