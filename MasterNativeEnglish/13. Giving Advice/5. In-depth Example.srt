1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:08,790
So now let's actually look at a real example of someone asking for advice about how to get in shape

2
00:00:08,850 --> 00:00:12,690
or get fit and how we can actually give advice to that person.

3
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:14,260
So two friends talking.

4
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:18,070
I'm having a hard time losing weight.

5
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:19,690
Now we know they're trying.

6
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:21,200
I'm having a hard time.

7
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:23,910
Hard time means it's difficult.

8
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:28,410
It's difficult having a hard time losing weight even though I don't overeat.

9
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:35,640
We use even though to say that something is kind of against something else I feel thirsty even though

10
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:37,670
I just had a glass of water.

11
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:38,270
OK.

12
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:42,600
I feel happy even though today was actually a pretty terrible day.

13
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:45,410
I feel happy even though it was a bad day.

14
00:00:45,410 --> 00:00:50,890
OK so I'm having a hard time losing weight even though I don't overeat.

15
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:51,930
I don't overeat.

16
00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:54,910
That means I think you can guess eat too much.

17
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:56,740
Could you give me some advice.

18
00:00:56,790 --> 00:00:59,870
That's one of the simple ways to get advice.

19
00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:05,070
Very direct way to get advice that we talked about at the very beginning of this lesson.

20
00:01:05,070 --> 00:01:12,030
Now we give the answer we give the advice to our friend and pay attention to some of the phrases that

21
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:13,760
we learned earlier in the class.

22
00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:17,340
Have you tried actually counting calories.

23
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:22,650
Calories are things that we have in food things that we eat which give us energy.

24
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:26,340
But also if we eat too many calories can make us make us fat.

25
00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:26,960
OK.

26
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:29,410
Have you tried counting calories OK.

27
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:33,000
That means you actually pay attention to how many calories you eat.

28
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,700
If so that means if the answer is yes.

29
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:40,520
If so that's a great way to make sure you aren't overdoing it.

30
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:44,780
So to overdo something means to do too much of that thing.

31
00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:50,150
What is overdoing it here overdoing it means eating too much overeating.

32
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:57,210
If you want to know if you're overeating maybe you think you're not overeating maybe you think that

33
00:01:57,210 --> 00:02:03,840
you don't overeat but maybe really you are maybe you're not eating very often but maybe the foods you're

34
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:06,780
eating are very high in calories.

35
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:07,120
OK.

36
00:02:07,130 --> 00:02:11,850
So count calories whenever I need to lose a few pounds.

37
00:02:11,850 --> 00:02:18,060
So now we use the one that shows that we are sharing our experience and also shows empathy whenever

38
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:19,580
I need to lose a few pounds.

39
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:24,790
I keep track of all my meals in a diet journal.

40
00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:25,040
OK.

41
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:31,570
So this diet means what we eat is what we eat is our diet our diet is the food that we eat usually.

42
00:02:31,690 --> 00:02:35,210
OK keep track of something means you pay attention to it.

43
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:36,870
You follow it carefully.

44
00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:37,150
OK.

45
00:02:37,170 --> 00:02:39,900
Anyway you should definitely try that.

46
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:42,120
Definitely makes it sound a little stronger.

47
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,390
You should remember.

48
00:02:43,410 --> 00:02:44,400
You should.

49
00:02:44,490 --> 00:02:46,870
Means it's a bit more forceful.

50
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:50,940
You're not saying you could you can you should say a little stronger.

51
00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:54,370
If that doesn't work you might try fasting.

52
00:02:54,390 --> 00:02:56,730
This is the same as you could try.

53
00:02:56,910 --> 00:02:58,960
So you might try you could try is the same.

54
00:02:59,010 --> 00:03:05,130
You might try fasting which I've been reading about lately so fasting means you don't eat for a long

55
00:03:05,130 --> 00:03:06,120
period of time.

56
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:08,580
Someone says I'm fasting.

57
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:15,720
That means maybe for this whole day or maybe for a week or whatever they're not eating you don't eat

58
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:16,800
for a period of time.

59
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:19,610
It's called fasting fasting.

60
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,440
People do it for many different reasons.

61
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:23,960
So let's continue with the advice again.

62
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:32,130
Pay attention to the phrases that we learned earlier in the lesson as far as exercise goes as far as

63
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:33,000
what does that mean.

64
00:03:33,210 --> 00:03:39,570
So sometimes when we want to change the topic and talk about something else we talked about diet.

65
00:03:39,570 --> 00:03:45,210
Now I want to change and talk about a new thing and we want to say what that new topic is we can use

66
00:03:45,390 --> 00:03:54,140
as far as or we can also use when it comes to whatever that is when it comes to exercise.

67
00:03:54,180 --> 00:04:01,410
As far as exercise goes these are basically the same used to change the topic used to mentioned what

68
00:04:01,410 --> 00:04:04,100
topic we're going to say as far as exercise goes.

69
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:09,840
You should definitely be doing some exercise every day every day.

70
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:14,760
First you can try going for a 30 minute run every morning.

71
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:20,930
And if that doesn't seem to be working after a few weeks we learned if that doesn't work.

72
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:28,980
But because it's kind of a continuous thing because it's kind of ongoing then we can say if that doesn't

73
00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:32,500
seem to be working OK.

74
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:39,180
If that doesn't seem to be working after a few weeks go to the gym at least three to four times when

75
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:47,670
we say when we see this and we read it we say three to four times three to four times a week.

76
00:04:47,670 --> 00:04:54,710
Notice that this doesn't say one week we usually just say a week three to four times a week.

77
00:04:54,840 --> 00:05:01,540
And because this is three or four we can actually use or if we want to if it's three to six.

78
00:05:01,550 --> 00:05:04,970
Then we have to say three to six.

79
00:05:05,030 --> 00:05:12,020
But because these two are side by side we can say three or four five or six six or seven but we can't

80
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:18,680
say three or six because that means you can't go four or five times which is very weird.

81
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:19,200
OK.

82
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:25,190
If that doesn't seem to be working after a few weeks go to the gym at least three to four times a week

83
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:29,230
and do both cardio and strength training.

84
00:05:29,230 --> 00:05:35,540
Anytime you see the word cardio it's going to be related to your heart or the system in your body where

85
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:39,520
the blood moves pumped by your heart.

86
00:05:39,530 --> 00:05:41,110
It's usually about heart health.

87
00:05:41,150 --> 00:05:46,760
So if you run if you jump if you go on a treadmill if you ride a bicycle.

88
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:55,280
This is cardio and strength training is lifting weights lifting weights weight lifting maybe you have

89
00:05:55,280 --> 00:06:00,720
some dumbbells or barbells or whatever you're trying to build muscle build muscle.

90
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:06,050
OK so this is how we can give advice about getting fit getting in shape.

91
00:06:06,050 --> 00:06:08,080
There are many different ways we can do it of course.

92
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:13,910
This is just one example but hopefully you have a pretty clear idea for how we can use some of these

93
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:16,820
different phrases to help our friend.

94
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:25,400
So as we usually do when we learn something the best way to make it stick is to actually practice it.

95
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:28,020
If you don't have somebody to practice with.

96
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:32,070
I always recommend that you record yourself get your phone out.

97
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:32,870
Record.

98
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:34,730
Record writing is good.

99
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:36,080
OK you can write.

100
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:37,070
That's fine.

101
00:06:37,070 --> 00:06:41,480
But if you write are you really going to be a better English speaker.

102
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:43,690
Well they are very different skills.

103
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:46,220
You can be a great writer and not a great speaker.

104
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:53,390
So I recommend that you get out your phone you turn on the record function and you try to use some of

105
00:06:53,390 --> 00:06:58,480
the words and phrases that we learned in this lesson for giving advice.

106
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:04,200
The assignment is to imagine that you have a friend who wants to quit smoking.

107
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:05,420
A big problem.

108
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:06,770
Addicted to smoking.

109
00:07:06,770 --> 00:07:08,590
Your friend is addicted to smoking.

110
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:14,030
So he or she has tried many things and everything has been unsuccessful.

111
00:07:14,030 --> 00:07:15,220
Nothing is working.

112
00:07:15,230 --> 00:07:17,240
So what advice would you give.

113
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:19,380
What advice would you give.

114
00:07:19,430 --> 00:07:22,700
Try to use the words and phrases we learned.

115
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:23,330
Good luck.
