1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:05,670
So there are a couple of really useful phrases that we can use to talk about fitness.

2
00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:11,880
We're going to talk about fitness because in a moment I'm going to give you an example of how we can

3
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:15,740
ask for advice about losing weight right.

4
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:17,060
We don't want to be so fat.

5
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:23,340
How one friend might ask another friend and then how we can give advice about that before we do we have

6
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:26,820
to go over a couple of useful words and phrases.

7
00:00:26,850 --> 00:00:27,080
OK.

8
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:31,100
So get in shape is when we're not in shape.

9
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:37,610
So being in shape means maybe you are fit which means maybe you have some muscle.

10
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:40,300
Maybe you don't have so much fat.

11
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:42,960
Maybe you can run without getting out of breath.

12
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:46,220
Maybe your heart is in a good condition right.

13
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:48,900
Maybe you can exercise without getting tired.

14
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:50,210
You are fit.

15
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:50,880
You are fit.

16
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:52,300
You are in shape.

17
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:54,780
It's not only about being thin.

18
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:57,000
It's not only about being fat it's more than that.

19
00:00:57,030 --> 00:01:02,940
You can be very very thin and very very out of shape.

20
00:01:02,970 --> 00:01:10,680
So I want to make it clear that thinness being slender is not the same as being in shape being in shape

21
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:15,050
includes strength includes some muscle.

22
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:15,830
OK.

23
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:17,670
Same with same with fitness.

24
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:18,480
Getting fit.

25
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:19,140
Same thing.

26
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:20,700
These are the same.

27
00:01:20,730 --> 00:01:21,260
OK.

28
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:22,680
Now lose weight.

29
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:25,350
What we really mean here is lose fat.

30
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:26,100
That's what it means.

31
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:28,410
We often say lose weight.

32
00:01:28,410 --> 00:01:30,080
I want to lose weight.

33
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:33,240
It's just a convenient way to say lose fat.

34
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:34,510
We don't say lose fat.

35
00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:41,130
Usually this is a little different than these two because you could lose weight because maybe you got

36
00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:47,190
really really ill or he's lost so much weight because of maybe the illness that would be a terrible

37
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:47,710
thing.

38
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:48,990
But are you fit.

39
00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:49,950
Probably not.

40
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:50,670
Probably not.

41
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:53,160
No you're not fat but you're also not fit.

42
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:53,560
OK.

43
00:01:53,610 --> 00:01:59,310
So losing weight is more general and this one is just about fat basically.

44
00:01:59,330 --> 00:01:59,690
OK.

45
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:03,480
Put on weight or put on a few.

46
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:11,550
And sometimes we can say a few pounds a few pounds put on a few pounds over Christmas.

47
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:14,420
I really put on a few pounds over Christmas.

48
00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:16,560
I really put on some weight.

49
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:23,490
Maybe you can see from the previous courses I've done that now I've I've put on a few I've put on a

50
00:02:23,490 --> 00:02:24,240
few.

51
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:31,890
Maybe you can tell from my my face compared to the previous courses the English brain ones and the pronunciation

52
00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:33,690
ones that I did before.

53
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:34,810
OK.

54
00:02:34,890 --> 00:02:41,910
So these are very common ways to talk about our condition and we have a few other specific words as

55
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:42,210
well.

56
00:02:42,210 --> 00:02:49,890
So let's look at those really quickly in America being very direct about somebody whose weight is not

57
00:02:49,890 --> 00:02:57,330
always a good thing and someone might be a little offended if you say she's fat he's fat.

58
00:02:57,330 --> 00:03:04,680
Even if they are what you might describe as fat there's just something about the culture and it's good

59
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:09,380
to know because if you say it too much people might feel a little offended.

60
00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:17,970
So we can say some other words a little bit is chubby someone is chubby they have some fat not so much.

61
00:03:17,970 --> 00:03:24,320
Not very very fat but we can describe them as chubby or a bit chubby.

62
00:03:24,330 --> 00:03:30,510
We can also describe someone as overweight you're overweight you're a bit overweight I think you need

63
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:32,030
to go on a diet.

64
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:37,740
OK so overweight means there they have too much fat they're too heavy they're more heavy than they should

65
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:40,710
be they're heavier than they should be overweight.

66
00:03:40,710 --> 00:03:44,320
This one's pretty common but this is more than this one.

67
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:47,930
This one is usually fatter than this one.

68
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:51,720
Now someone might describe someone who is fat as heavy.

69
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:54,180
It's actually a more polite way to say it.

70
00:03:54,210 --> 00:03:58,230
So if you said Oh yeah you're your uncle's he's a bit heavy.

71
00:03:58,230 --> 00:03:58,650
Right.

72
00:03:58,650 --> 00:04:00,090
He's a bit heavy isn't he.

73
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:01,850
Yeah he's he's a bit heavy.

74
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:04,800
Sometimes we say heavy set heavy set.

75
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:08,340
She's she's quite a lot heavier than she used to be.

76
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:08,820
Wow.

77
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:11,390
She's much heavier than she used to be.

78
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:15,260
It's more polite than saying She's fatter than she used to be.

79
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:17,160
Your uncle is very fat right.

80
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:25,920
So saying fat is kind of like hitting somebody in the head with maybe truth maybe real information but

81
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:33,780
in a way that makes them feel maybe not so good so often use heavy sometimes overweight sometimes chubby.

82
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:39,210
And it's interesting how in different cultures what is fat is described differently.

83
00:04:39,210 --> 00:04:46,890
I've noticed for example that someone who might be considered normal in America in a lot of Asian countries

84
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:54,510
like China for example that person might be considered fat and even if you've got a little fat someone

85
00:04:54,510 --> 00:04:58,150
in China might say oh you're fat it's a different culture.

86
00:04:58,170 --> 00:04:59,040
That's quite interesting.
