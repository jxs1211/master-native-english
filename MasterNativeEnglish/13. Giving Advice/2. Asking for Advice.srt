1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:08,970
When we have an issue and we ask for advice sometimes we can just come right out and say Could you give

2
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:11,630
me some advice.

3
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:17,950
Then after our friend says Yeah sure we can say what we need advice about.

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,360
Sometimes we say this after Listen I'm having a problem with blah blah blah blah.

5
00:00:23,370 --> 00:00:25,640
Could you give me some advice please.

6
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:27,770
Could you please give me some advice.

7
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:30,900
And then our friend can give us advice.

8
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:34,820
Now again usually advice is something a little more serious.

9
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:37,140
It can be used for very simple things.

10
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:40,110
Should I wear the blue one or the red one.

11
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:41,580
Give me some advice.

12
00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:42,020
OK.

13
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:42,770
It's OK.

14
00:00:42,830 --> 00:00:43,300
Sure.

15
00:00:43,330 --> 00:00:51,360
Sure we can do that but advice is a great word to describe somewhat more serious situations problems

16
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:53,280
that we're facing in our lives.

17
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:55,400
Can you give me some advice please.

18
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:56,560
Or I could.

19
00:00:56,580 --> 00:00:57,180
That's an L..

20
00:00:57,210 --> 00:01:03,380
I could really use some or your advice.

21
00:01:03,450 --> 00:01:04,980
I could really use some advice.

22
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:08,550
I could really use your advice.

23
00:01:08,550 --> 00:01:09,170
I need some help.

24
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:14,760
I need some help can be used in lots of other situations.

25
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:16,470
I need some help.

26
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:20,490
Could be about I don't know carrying a sofa but I need some help.

27
00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:22,890
Could be asking for advice.

28
00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:27,390
Listen my boyfriend broke up with me and said something really terrible.

29
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:28,940
I don't know what I should do.

30
00:01:29,010 --> 00:01:30,960
I need help.

31
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:31,960
I need advice.

32
00:01:32,010 --> 00:01:35,990
So there it's the same although help can be about many other things too.

33
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:47,550
Now to be more casual about it we could say I wonder if you could tell me what you think about so maybe

34
00:01:47,550 --> 00:01:49,110
we're looking for a new job.

35
00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:52,800
I wonder if you could tell me what you think about working at Google.

36
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:55,190
Do you think it would be do you think it would be cool.

37
00:01:55,200 --> 00:02:01,620
I wonder if you could tell me what you think about or you could just say this part.

38
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:06,810
What do what do you think about me working at Google.

39
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:10,130
What do you think about me working that's whole.

40
00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:12,400
That's a riff it's the worst one so far.

41
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:14,900
Working at Google.

42
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:15,560
OK.

43
00:02:15,590 --> 00:02:17,650
So we can ask for advice in this way.

44
00:02:17,730 --> 00:02:27,020
That's a little bit more a little bit more casual now as I mentioned advice can be kind of the same

45
00:02:27,050 --> 00:02:29,710
as a suggestion or a recommendation.

46
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:37,670
So we could say could could you recommend some or you could say suggest here.

47
00:02:37,670 --> 00:02:47,330
You could also say suggest maybe could you suggest some ideas for how our company can maybe deal with

48
00:02:47,450 --> 00:02:49,430
our financial problems.

49
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:51,430
Could you suggest some.

50
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:52,320
This one again.

51
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:53,180
Is it advice.

52
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:55,180
Is it a suggestion OK.

53
00:02:55,190 --> 00:02:58,110
Maybe they're kind of very similar.

54
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:05,820
So it's OK if we use the word recommend or suggest when we're asking for advice that's totally ok.
