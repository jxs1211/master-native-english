00:00:04,020 --> 00:00:10,650
In the last lesson we talked about movies and TV very important in this lesson we're going to talk about

2
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:13,560
how to give advice.

3
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:18,960
Now this is different than what we would usually call recommending because sometimes recommending is

4
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:23,280
more about what should I order or what movie should I watch.

5
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:31,770
Advice is often more serious advice is usually about a problem that we're having in our lives or our

6
00:00:31,770 --> 00:00:33,750
friends are having in their lives.

7
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:39,930
And so when we need help with this kind of thing we ask for advice in this lesson we're going to talk

8
00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:42,270
about how we can ask for advice.

9
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:47,460
We're also going to talk about ways we can give advice some different phrases we can use for giving

10
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:53,160
advice then we're going to look at a specific example we're going to talk about some words and phrases

11
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:59,130
we can use to talk about fitness being overweight because that's the example that we're going to actually

12
00:00:59,130 --> 00:01:07,050
look at how someone would give a friend advice using the words and phrases that we've learned to let's

13
00:01:07,050 --> 00:01:07,600
get started.
