1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:06,290
So far in this lesson we've been focusing on one expression for each situation in this one.

2
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:12,210
In this situation I want to share a couple because there are a couple different ones that are really

3
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:17,620
relevant to this situation and can be used in other places as well.

4
00:00:17,630 --> 00:00:22,410
OK so you're relying on your parents for money that means you don't have your own money.

5
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:24,250
Maybe you don't have a job.

6
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:27,220
You can't find a decent job to support yourself.

7
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:33,750
Support yourself means you can buy your own food you can pay your own rent can buy your own clothes.

8
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:36,660
This is what it means to support yourself.

9
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:42,930
Well very simply if you want to express that you don't have money we often just say that I'm broke I'm

10
00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:44,060
totally broke.

11
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:50,470
B R O K E broke Hey do you want to go get a drink.

12
00:00:50,470 --> 00:00:51,450
No I can't.

13
00:00:51,450 --> 00:00:51,840
Why not.

14
00:00:52,290 --> 00:00:52,890
I'm broke.

15
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:53,990
I have no money.

16
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:56,370
Oh I'll lend you 20 dollars.

17
00:00:56,370 --> 00:00:57,660
No no that's OK.

18
00:00:57,660 --> 00:01:01,270
I don't want to borrow any money I'm broke to stay home.

19
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:09,210
OK so being broke is not fun having no money is not fun but it's a common expression and sometimes people

20
00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:17,540
add if it's really a bad situation flat FFO a t flat broke after my vacation to Japan.

21
00:01:17,550 --> 00:01:19,160
I was flat broke.

22
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:23,630
I had to save up for two years before I could take another trip.

23
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:25,620
I was flat broke.

24
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:31,020
OK can be used in a lot of different cases where you want to say that you don't have any money left

25
00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:36,570
right now when we're in this situation where you rely on your parents at least in America.

26
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:41,860
I know in some countries relying on your parents and getting money from your parents is fine.

27
00:01:41,910 --> 00:01:43,120
It's not an issue.

28
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,500
Well in America it is.

29
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:52,140
I read a news story about a man who was 30 years old and hadn't moved out of his parent's home and was

30
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:55,820
sued by his parents for not leaving.

31
00:01:55,830 --> 00:02:01,590
So this is kind of American culture you've got to get out and support yourself as soon as possible maybe

32
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:03,870
even as young as 18 years old.

33
00:02:03,870 --> 00:02:04,250
Really.

34
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:04,650
Really.

35
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:05,180
Yes.

36
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:05,840
Yes.

37
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:07,590
It's kind of American culture.

38
00:02:07,650 --> 00:02:14,280
So if you find yourself in the situation where you can't support yourself in American culture at least

39
00:02:14,610 --> 00:02:16,720
you might feel like a failure.

40
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:18,150
You won't feel good.

41
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:21,510
Maybe you were doing OK before and then you lost all your money.

42
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:22,170
Not happy.

43
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:22,490
OK.

44
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:31,490
So you can say I've really hit rock bottom I've really hit rock bottom.

45
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:32,800
I can't go lower.

46
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:35,390
Imagine falling down into the ocean.

47
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:36,930
You reach the bottom of the ocean.

48
00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:38,280
You can't go any deeper.

49
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:42,280
So you've hit rock bottom you're as far down as you can go.

50
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:43,770
And it's not a happy thing.

51
00:02:43,770 --> 00:02:45,320
Now it doesn't have to only be for money.

52
00:02:45,330 --> 00:02:52,440
So broke is only about only about money but hitting rock bottom is more an emotional thing a thing related

53
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:55,410
to your life and the situation of your life.

54
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:59,700
So you could emotionally be completely unhappy because everything went wrong.

55
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:01,100
Maybe you have lots of money.

56
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:08,220
You can still say I hit rock bottom I've completely hit rock bottom because for whatever reason you're

57
00:03:08,610 --> 00:03:14,880
extremely depressed you're extremely sad and you feel like there's no lower that you can go.

58
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:18,900
OK so just to be clear that this one broke is for money.

59
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:20,250
Rock bottom is not.

60
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:26,820
So maybe there's a man who lost his lost his job still has money but lost his job then his girlfriend

61
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:34,110
broke up with him and he still has his own apartment but he just feels like he doesn't know what to

62
00:03:34,110 --> 00:03:35,350
do with his life.

63
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:40,980
He has money but he might say I just feel like I've hit rock bottom and I don't know what to do with

64
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:41,670
myself.

65
00:03:41,730 --> 00:03:46,930
That would be a common thing someone in that situation might say it's emotional.

66
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:49,500
Negative negative.

67
00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:59,220
So as a response to that friend might say well you hit rock bottom it's it's all uphill from here.

68
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:01,130
That means it can't get any worse.

69
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:04,760
And that's something that people will say too well it can't get any worse.

70
00:04:04,770 --> 00:04:06,070
Look at the bright side.

71
00:04:06,090 --> 00:04:07,350
It can't get any worse.

72
00:04:07,350 --> 00:04:08,920
It's all uphill from here.

73
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:12,600
If it's really rock bottom OK that would be really optimistic.

74
00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:17,580
That's looking at the bright side looking at the bright side of something means you're looking at that.

75
00:04:17,610 --> 00:04:18,530
Good point.

76
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:19,420
That's there.

77
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:24,750
Even if it's very small and if it is very small there's a very tiny positive thing about a very bad

78
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:25,580
situation.

79
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:34,260
We often call that the silver as I LV are lining lining silver lining is that if it can't get worse

80
00:04:34,290 --> 00:04:41,970
if you've really hit rock bottom then all you have to do is pick yourself up go out there and get a

81
00:04:41,970 --> 00:04:44,630
new job got a new girlfriend.

82
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:45,950
It's all uphill from here.

83
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:46,830
It's going to get better.

84
00:04:46,830 --> 00:04:49,600
That's the silver lining that's the silver lining.

85
00:04:49,710 --> 00:04:51,020
Yeah maybe you're right.

86
00:04:51,030 --> 00:04:51,710
Thanks.

87
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:53,930
You made me feel better you made me feel better.

88
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:54,410
OK.

89
00:04:54,510 --> 00:04:58,080
So these are the expressions that we can use in negative situations.

90
00:04:58,230 --> 00:05:05,010
These two side and Silver Lining are positive aspects of the negative situation.

91
00:05:05,030 --> 00:05:08,840
The good points of the bad situation and the bad feeling.

92
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:15,200
I'd like to stick with this situation for one more expression because I think we need to focus a little

93
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:16,160
bit more on money.

94
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:20,900
We talked about being broke which means you have no money left but there's a more general one that can

95
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:24,920
be used to talk about a bad financial situation.

96
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:30,230
Because saying I'm broke is a little strong and some people might not be willing to express something

97
00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:41,120
that directly so we could say here it was it was really difficult to make ends meet.

98
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:46,250
So I had to move back home.

99
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:51,320
So maybe I was living alone I was living in my own apartment I was doing ok but things got worse.

100
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:56,900
Maybe my financial situation my financial or money situation was not great.

101
00:05:56,990 --> 00:06:00,200
So I was having trouble making ends meet.

102
00:06:00,230 --> 00:06:04,310
That might mean I have some money but I can't pay all my bills.

103
00:06:04,310 --> 00:06:07,480
I have some money but I can't completely support myself.

104
00:06:07,490 --> 00:06:12,220
So I had to move back in with my parents couldn't make ends meet.

105
00:06:12,230 --> 00:06:16,610
Another common expression this one is only only for money.

106
00:06:16,610 --> 00:06:22,230
This one is used to talk about being able to afford whatever lifestyle you have.

107
00:06:22,670 --> 00:06:27,350
If you can make ends meet then maybe you don't need to move in with your parents but if you cannot make

108
00:06:27,350 --> 00:06:33,380
ends meet you may need to move in with your parents and in American culture that's generally not a good

109
00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:33,940
thing.

110
00:06:33,950 --> 00:06:39,570
People might judge you negatively although in lots of other places in the world it's fine it's fine.

111
00:06:39,710 --> 00:06:43,790
It's interesting how different cultures are different and judge things differently.

112
00:06:43,790 --> 00:06:52,820
I told some of my my friends in China the story about the man who who was sued by his parents for living

113
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:58,880
at home too long and they couldn't believe that it was real because generally speaking in China if you

114
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:03,830
live with your parents that's a good thing because it means you're willing to take care of them and

115
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:09,620
generally parents are very happy to have their kids living with them even if they're 30 maybe maybe

116
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:17,420
even older now that's of course changing a little bit in the modern modern era but it's still quite

117
00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:17,870
different.

118
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:26,140
Americans they generally focus on being very independent is a good word to use independent.

119
00:07:26,150 --> 00:07:31,460
All right let's go on and look at another situation and learn another useful expression.
