1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:04,620
So the first situation we're going to look at is addiction.

2
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:05,420
Addiction.

3
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:07,530
Somebody is doing something too much.

4
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:14,020
Well if you have a good friend who's doing something too much you might want to help them.

5
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:17,870
You may need to mention to your friend that there hey there is a problem.

6
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:20,040
Maybe this is not healthy for you.

7
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:21,920
Well let's focus on video games.

8
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:23,700
Not to say that video games are bad.

9
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:24,850
I like video games.

10
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:31,050
But sometimes people can get addicted addicted to video games and if they get addicted to video games.

11
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:32,430
Well what happens.

12
00:00:32,550 --> 00:00:37,680
Maybe other things in that person's life may be out of balance right.

13
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:41,050
So you think your friend is spending too much time playing video games.

14
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:45,750
How can you bring up mentioned the topic and make it softer.

15
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:50,310
This means we don't want to be too direct because if we're too direct and we say something like Hey

16
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:54,900
friend you have a problem what do people do when you say that to them.

17
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:56,790
Well they become defensive.

18
00:00:56,790 --> 00:00:57,980
They might say oh no I don't.

19
00:00:58,050 --> 00:01:03,060
I don't talk about her and not want to talk to you if you criticize people too directly.

20
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:07,400
Usually they become defensive and they don't want to listen to what you're saying.

21
00:01:07,410 --> 00:01:16,250
So how can we say that we can bring up the topic of hey you have this problem without being too straight.

22
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:17,280
How can we do that.

23
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:24,990
Well there's one very common expression that we can use to express the idea of addiction and we can

24
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:26,940
use it for many other situations too.

25
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:32,960
And that is that is out of hand now out of hand.

26
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,960
It's sort of like saying out of control not in control.

27
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:40,230
And we'll talk about other situations in which we can use it.

28
00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:42,810
But let's just focus on this situation first.

29
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:45,540
OK let's let's say it like this.

30
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:48,040
Hey Tom can I can I talk to you for a second.

31
00:01:48,910 --> 00:01:49,370
Yeah yeah.

32
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:49,830
What's up.

33
00:01:49,830 --> 00:01:51,870
So we might say listen listen.

34
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:55,490
It's a way to begin a serious topic I think.

35
00:01:55,800 --> 00:02:02,490
I think your gaming habit is getting a bit.

36
00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:05,160
Remember we use a bit when we want to make things softer.

37
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:05,430
Right.

38
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:10,700
So it's always useful a bit out of hand.

39
00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:13,770
And this is the expression that we're learning how to use.

40
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:18,420
Well that's a big difference between saying you have a problem and I think you're gaming habit is getting

41
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:19,290
a bit out of hand.

42
00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:27,040
This is so soft that Tom is likely to be more receptive and listen to what you're saying.

43
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:29,240
Do you think so.

44
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:31,350
Yeah I know but I can't stop.

45
00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:33,400
Well then we can talk about solutions.

46
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:34,860
So a bit out of hand.

47
00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:42,960
I do want to get into using out of hand in more situations how else it can be used but very quickly

48
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:48,030
we could also say I think your gaming habit is getting a bit out of hand and we could add.

49
00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:57,030
And you really need to draw the line somewhere.

50
00:02:57,180 --> 00:02:57,570
OK.

51
00:02:57,570 --> 00:03:05,400
So this one to draw the line somewhere is to create a limit any anytime you want to talk about giving

52
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:07,630
yourself a limit or giving others a limit.

53
00:03:07,710 --> 00:03:09,540
We might say draw the line.

54
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:11,380
I'm going to draw the line with you.

55
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:16,050
You can only watch TV for an hour a day maybe a mother will say that to her son.

56
00:03:16,050 --> 00:03:18,180
I'm really going to have to draw the line.

57
00:03:18,450 --> 00:03:22,620
Well you could say it for yourself and you really need to draw the line somewhere.

58
00:03:22,710 --> 00:03:27,740
That means you need to create a limit for yourself about how much you're going to play.

59
00:03:27,770 --> 00:03:28,100
Right.

60
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:30,570
An hour a day two hours a day and then stop.

61
00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:31,890
Draw the line somewhere.

62
00:03:31,890 --> 00:03:32,100
All right.

63
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:38,910
Let's go back to out of hand and other places where we can use it to express a situation that is no

64
00:03:38,910 --> 00:03:40,380
longer in control.

65
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:47,250
Have you ever seen on the news crowd of people we could say even a mob of people smashing windows in

66
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:49,830
the streets and flipping over cars.

67
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:53,570
Sometimes it's after a sports match or some other reason.

68
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:54,270
Doesn't matter.

69
00:03:54,270 --> 00:03:59,420
Well in this case maybe the police no longer have control over the situation.

70
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:00,260
Maybe they did.

71
00:04:00,270 --> 00:04:06,700
They had control they had control and then it reached a point where the police no longer have control.

72
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:17,360
So we can say the mob the mob the mob started to get out of hand out of hand.

73
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:24,000
So you can use it for your self your habits what you do if you do something too much.

74
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:26,150
When you lose control of that thing.

75
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:31,140
But it can also be used to describe something out there in the world with people.

76
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:36,020
And for example maybe the police have control or should have control but now they don't.

77
00:04:36,030 --> 00:04:39,710
And so it's out of hand it's out of hand.

78
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:40,520
OK.

79
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:45,440
So it's a very very useful and it can be used in all kinds of situations.

80
00:04:45,450 --> 00:04:52,340
Let's go on and look at another situation and another very useful expression we can use in that situation.
