1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:05,850
Now let's look at the last situation in this lesson the last one we're going to talk about and it is

2
00:00:05,850 --> 00:00:06,890
quite a common one.

3
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:10,810
So we'll dive into two different expressions for it.

4
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:11,150
OK.

5
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:13,020
Two people are in a car.

6
00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:13,830
One is the driver.

7
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:16,410
The other is the passenger in the front seat.

8
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:20,940
They are looking for a certain restaurant but neither are sure where it is.

9
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:27,670
The driver needs to focus on driving so he tells the other person to carefully watch for the place.

10
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:29,440
They want to go.

11
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:37,980
So maybe the restaurant lets make a name let's say the restaurant's name is Cleo's and it's we know

12
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:41,670
it's going to be a blue a blue sign.

13
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:45,560
We know the sign on the restaurant is blue and we know it's called Cleo's gay.

14
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:46,680
But I need to drive.

15
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:49,370
I can't be doing this right.

16
00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:51,100
Maybe we're not using G.P.S..

17
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:51,630
OK.

18
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:55,160
I can't look back and forth all the time so I need your help.

19
00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:57,260
That's the situation I need you to help me.

20
00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:00,510
So you need to be doing this while I'm driving.

21
00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:01,410
So what can we say.

22
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:05,740
Well we can use an expression that we learned earlier in the lesson.

23
00:01:05,910 --> 00:01:13,020
The second one that we learned was to keep an eye on something we can change it slightly and use the

24
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:19,190
same expression almost to say to watch for something we can say it like this.

25
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:32,840
Hey hey keep an eye out for a blue sign that says Cleo's OK.

26
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:35,280
So that means doesn't have to be one eye.

27
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:35,610
Right.

28
00:01:35,610 --> 00:01:41,940
But it just means to be aware of what's going on around us so that you can spot it when we're close.

29
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:43,340
We can use this expression.

30
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:46,550
Keep an eye out for lots of other things.

31
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:53,880
It just means to be aware of what's going on around you so that you can catch something or spot something

32
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:59,760
when it appears when it's there doesn't mean you actually look look look look look for it we'll just

33
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:03,220
do what you do normally but make sure you have your awareness.

34
00:02:03,330 --> 00:02:04,980
Make sure you're aware of what's going on.

35
00:02:05,190 --> 00:02:11,670
So can you please keep an eye out for any opportunities job opportunities that you think would be good

36
00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:15,910
for me if you hear about any opportunities please let me know.

37
00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:18,620
So that doesn't mean you need to look for a job for me.

38
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:25,460
But if you do talk to anybody who mentions that there's a job opening or an availability.

39
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:26,940
Well maybe I would be a good fit.

40
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:28,220
You can tell me about that.

41
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:29,660
Keep an eye out for that.

42
00:02:29,850 --> 00:02:30,360
OK.

43
00:02:30,510 --> 00:02:37,920
Keep an eye out for articles about maybe this thing I'm trying to understand better maybe there's a

44
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:44,250
topic that I'm trying to learn more about maybe A.I. for example keep an eye out for articles about

45
00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:47,500
A.I. research and if you find any send them to me.

46
00:02:47,550 --> 00:02:52,530
That doesn't mean you need to go and look for a bunch of articles but you need to be aware of what's

47
00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:58,650
going on around you so that if you do find any as you're browsing on the internet then you can send

48
00:02:58,650 --> 00:02:59,300
them to me.

49
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:00,710
Keep an eye out for that.

50
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,160
So it's really useful.

51
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:07,210
It's really useful because it's very versatile because it can be used in so many different ways.

52
00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:14,340
OK but there's another one that we use for the car situation which is not so flexible which can not

53
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:17,430
be used in as General away.

54
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:24,260
And that is and that is keep your eyes peeled.

55
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:31,110
Keep your eyes peeled for a blue sign that says Cleo's that one is generally only for things that we're

56
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:34,740
looking at with the articles with the job opportunities.

57
00:03:34,770 --> 00:03:38,880
That's not something that we necessarily see we could hear about it.

58
00:03:38,910 --> 00:03:40,680
We could just know about it.

59
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:42,740
We can find out about it in any way.

60
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:49,620
So it's not only about your eye seeing something but keep your eyes peeled for something usually is

61
00:03:49,890 --> 00:03:51,180
only your eyes.

62
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:54,330
Keep your eyes peeled for a sign that says Cleo's it's blue.

63
00:03:54,330 --> 00:03:54,750
OK.

64
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:59,090
I will I will I will keep your eyes peeled for the shore.

65
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:00,720
We're out on a boat OK.

66
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:03,960
And we're trying to get back before the storm comes.

67
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:06,490
Keep your eyes peeled for the shoreline.

68
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:07,050
There it is.

69
00:04:07,050 --> 00:04:07,560
There it is.

70
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:08,520
I see it.

71
00:04:08,610 --> 00:04:12,370
So keeping your eyes peeled is actually looking out for something specific.

72
00:04:12,390 --> 00:04:13,620
You know what you're looking for.

73
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:16,230
You don't know exactly where it is.

74
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:17,950
So that's the difference between them.

75
00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:22,960
Keep an eye out for is much more general and very useful.

76
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:27,570
The expressions that we talked about in this lesson are all really common and so are the situations

77
00:04:27,570 --> 00:04:29,560
that we learn them in.

78
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:34,080
I hope you found this lesson both useful and interesting.

79
00:04:34,110 --> 00:04:39,840
So what I'd like you to do to practice is to try to write two examples for each of the expressions that

80
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:42,180
we learned more generally.

81
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:47,880
I'd like you to try to use them when you find yourself in similar situations to the situations we talked

82
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:49,400
about in this lesson.

83
00:04:49,410 --> 00:04:57,210
One thing that it's very important to keep in mind is that situations offer the context within which

84
00:04:57,210 --> 00:05:03,800
we can really understand what an Russian means if you just learn the expression it's really hard to

85
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:08,510
get the actual meaning and it's very hard to actually use it naturally.

86
00:05:08,510 --> 00:05:15,460
But when you learn it in a situation in context that becomes much easier you understand.

87
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:18,420
Oh this works here but not there.

88
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:24,230
And I hope I've made in this lesson I hope I've made those those distinctions clear.

89
00:05:24,290 --> 00:05:29,900
So when you're watching movies when you're having conversations with others when you're reading whatever

90
00:05:30,140 --> 00:05:36,230
pay very careful attention to not only the new expressions the new words pay very close attention to

91
00:05:36,230 --> 00:05:43,690
the context because context can give you the usage and that is actually really important.

92
00:05:43,790 --> 00:05:48,670
Just because something means this doesn't necessarily mean you should use it all the time.

93
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:51,470
You have to know when people usually use it.

94
00:05:51,490 --> 00:05:51,780
OK.

95
00:05:52,010 --> 00:05:55,280
So practice this and I'll see you in the next lesson.
