1
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:07,020
In the last lesson we talked about technical language.

2
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:08,320
We talked about dates.

3
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:10,050
We talked about numbers.

4
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:16,500
We talked about math problems addresses in this lesson we're going to focus on common situations that

5
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:23,130
we need to deal with in daily life and expressions we can use to handle those situations.

6
00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:29,790
So I want to be clear from the start the expressions that we use can be used often in many different

7
00:00:29,790 --> 00:00:37,500
situations but we're going to learn them in the context of everyday situations that you will probably

8
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:40,910
come across on a regular basis.

9
00:00:40,910 --> 00:00:42,090
OK so let's get started.

10
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:47,490
I'm going to introduce the situations and then I'm going to introduce the expressions that can be used

11
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:48,900
in those situations.

12
00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:54,510
And then we'll talk about maybe some other ways that those expressions can be used.

13
00:00:54,510 --> 00:00:55,350
So let's begin.
