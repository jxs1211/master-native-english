00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:05,160
So far in this lesson on expressions in common situations we've talked about.

2
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:08,400
Keep an eye on and out of hand.

3
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:12,100
Now we're going to look at another situation moving to another place.

4
00:00:12,250 --> 00:00:18,730
OK so you're moving to another city and you don't need a lot of stuff in your house that you have now.

5
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:26,220
The one you're living in now so you've decided to give it away your stuff to whoever asks for it first.

6
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:32,610
So if you move to a new house where you buy a new house sometimes your old stuff you want to get new

7
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:34,460
stuff so you want to leave it behind.

8
00:00:34,650 --> 00:00:40,590
Maybe the sofa the pots and pans pots and pans are what you used to cook this stuff.

9
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:42,630
You don't want to take to the new house.

10
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:46,260
You want to get brand new stuff but it's still useful.

11
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:47,780
Maybe somebody wants it.

12
00:00:47,790 --> 00:00:51,670
Maybe you'd like to give it away for free to your friends.

13
00:00:51,670 --> 00:00:52,680
Well that's possible.

14
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:54,900
OK so that's the situation.

15
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:59,610
What expression can we use to get it across to announce it to our friends.

16
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:02,900
Let's say I'm going to make a post on social media.

17
00:01:02,970 --> 00:01:06,160
That's the best way to let a lot of people know something.

18
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:06,660
Right.

19
00:01:06,660 --> 00:01:12,360
Maybe it's Facebook maybe it's Instagram maybe it's whatever you use maybe as we chat maybe it's line.

20
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:18,300
I don't know whatever you use whatever you use you're going to post make a post.

21
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:19,890
You could say this to a person.

22
00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:20,450
Sure.

23
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:23,010
But it's better if it's said to a whole group of people.

24
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:24,240
All your friends.

25
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:24,570
All right.

26
00:01:24,870 --> 00:01:28,380
So my sofa my sofa.

27
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:42,090
You could say my sofa at the old place at the or my old place is now the expression up for grabs if

28
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:44,330
anybody needs it.

29
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:51,220
Or we could say once at my sofa is up for grabs ups I wrote is here my bad.

30
00:01:51,330 --> 00:01:57,510
If if anybody needs it if anybody wants it then what does that mean.

31
00:01:57,510 --> 00:01:58,820
Well it's sort of like I.

32
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:02,620
They're all my friends over there and I throw my sofa to them.

33
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:04,710
Why throw my sofa out.

34
00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:06,390
I don't want it anybody want it.

35
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:09,530
Whoever reaches up and grabs it and takes it.

36
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:11,830
They're the one who gets my sofa.

37
00:02:11,890 --> 00:02:20,810
They grab Remember we learned grab before grab means to get to take like that but saying that you want

38
00:02:20,810 --> 00:02:25,810
it is kind of the same as reaching out and doing that and grabbing it with your hand.

39
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:26,960
It's kind of the same.

40
00:02:26,990 --> 00:02:33,200
So we use up for grabs when something is available to anyone to take.

41
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:36,900
Could be a sofa could be physically grabbing something.

42
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:39,870
It could also be for example for a position.

43
00:02:39,890 --> 00:02:42,410
So this one is somebody is going to say Oh yeah.

44
00:02:42,410 --> 00:02:43,530
Me me me me me I want it.

45
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:44,300
I want the sofa.

46
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:45,630
Me me me me me.

47
00:02:45,650 --> 00:02:47,360
Someone might say dibs.

48
00:02:47,510 --> 00:02:48,380
Dibs.

49
00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:50,800
Dibs on the sofa.

50
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:51,870
Dibs on the sofa.

51
00:02:51,890 --> 00:02:52,490
Dibs.

52
00:02:52,490 --> 00:02:56,110
That means I claim that it's an informal expression.

53
00:02:56,150 --> 00:02:58,190
I claim that sofa that's my sofa.

54
00:02:58,190 --> 00:02:58,850
The first person.

55
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:00,000
OK you got it.

56
00:03:00,050 --> 00:03:06,620
Because it's up for grabs but we can use this expression up for grabs for example in maybe a political

57
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:09,270
race two people running for the presidency.

58
00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:10,000
They want to get it.

59
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:11,350
It's up for grabs.

60
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:12,650
We don't know who's going to win.

61
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:19,550
Often we describe situations as up for grabs when we have no idea who's going to win.

62
00:03:19,550 --> 00:03:25,560
So for example there are two teams playing in a championship final right.

63
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:29,860
Maybe it's the World Cup or whatever and they're equally matched.

64
00:03:29,870 --> 00:03:35,360
We really don't know if this team is going to win or this team if it's not equal and this team is way

65
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:38,230
better than this team then we probably won't say it.

66
00:03:38,450 --> 00:03:45,230
But if it's pretty much equal we'll say I don't know who's going to win this year it's really up for

67
00:03:45,590 --> 00:03:46,520
grabs.

68
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:48,710
It's really up for grabs.

69
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:49,920
So that's how it's used.

70
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:54,990
That's how it's used and DBS is used to claim things in a kind of informal way.

71
00:03:55,010 --> 00:03:58,520
People will just say dibs Debs or dibs on that.

72
00:03:58,580 --> 00:04:01,910
Dibs on that very common expression up for grabs.
