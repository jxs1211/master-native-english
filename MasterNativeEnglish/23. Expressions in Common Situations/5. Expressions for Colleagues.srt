1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:06,570
OK so let's continue and look at another situation and another common phrase we can use to express ourselves

2
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:07,830
in that situation.

3
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:14,760
So have you ever experienced a co-worker another person maybe getting fired and then another person

4
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:21,660
your colleague said something negative or insulting about them and you don't like that actually can

5
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:27,330
work for a situation where anybody says something and you don't like that they said it and you think

6
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:29,970
it's not appropriate that they said it.

7
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:32,000
You think it's wrong that they said it.

8
00:00:32,060 --> 00:00:34,150
You want to express that you think that.

9
00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:36,080
Well don't say don't say that.

10
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:38,620
I suppose you could but there is a better way.

11
00:00:38,890 --> 00:00:45,080
So your co-worker just got fired and another co-worker makes an insulting comment about them.

12
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:48,390
The person who got fired like they were useless anyway.

13
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:50,250
Well that's not nice that's mean.

14
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:54,190
I mean that's cruel pay.

15
00:00:54,290 --> 00:00:58,490
That's what we can use to express our emotion our sort of surprise our shock.

16
00:00:58,490 --> 00:01:03,410
Hey that's a bit uncalled for uncalled for uncalled for.

17
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:05,240
Nobody's perfect.

18
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:08,720
Nobody nobody is perfect.

19
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:13,730
So when something happens or something is said and the thing that happens with the thing that is said

20
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:19,880
is maybe rude inappropriate not the right thing in this situation.

21
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:20,910
Just not good.

22
00:01:20,930 --> 00:01:24,550
And you want to declare it use uncalled for.

23
00:01:24,740 --> 00:01:26,690
Could be an action for example.

24
00:01:26,690 --> 00:01:31,390
You're watching a sports game and one player just punches another player.

25
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:33,830
You could say whoa whoa whoa.

26
00:01:33,830 --> 00:01:35,580
That was uncalled for.

27
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:36,860
He shouldn't have done that.

28
00:01:36,860 --> 00:01:38,180
That was not necessary.

29
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:44,660
Basically the meaning of this is not necessary not necessary unneeded.

30
00:01:44,660 --> 00:01:45,190
OK.

31
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:49,700
You don't need to say something negative about the co-worker who just laughed right.

32
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:51,590
I mean they just got fired.

33
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:53,560
They're probably having a terrible day.

34
00:01:53,570 --> 00:01:56,120
Why do you need to say something negative about them.

35
00:01:56,180 --> 00:01:57,920
That's really uncalled for.

36
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:59,030
That's really uncalled for.

37
00:01:59,540 --> 00:02:02,240
But at the same time it's polite.

38
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:08,000
If I say that to my co-worker who said the negative thing the insulting thing and that's pretty uncalled

39
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:15,680
for I'm being kind of polite but still mentioning that I'm not okay with the comment then maybe my co-worker

40
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:23,030
will say Yeah yeah I'm sorry I shouldn't have said that I shouldn't I shouldn't have said that I shouldn't

41
00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:24,650
have said it.

42
00:02:24,830 --> 00:02:31,070
Maybe they apologize whatever but uncalled for is the expression that I use to bring up the fact that

43
00:02:31,070 --> 00:02:32,110
it's not OK.

44
00:02:32,210 --> 00:02:36,300
It's really common for actions for things that are said.

45
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:38,580
One more example of uncalled for.

46
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:49,790
Might be the companies companies decision to ban band means you're not allowed to do that to ban shorts

47
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:51,810
is uncalled for.

48
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:57,740
Maybe we work in a company that's pretty informal generally and a lot of people wear shorts when they

49
00:02:57,740 --> 00:02:59,030
come into work OK.

50
00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:02,930
But the company has decided no they will not allow shorts.

51
00:03:02,930 --> 00:03:04,810
Well I don't like that my opinion.

52
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:12,410
That's not OK so I'll say hey this decision to ban shorts is uncalled for unnecessary unnecessary.

53
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:18,890
So that's how we use it a similar expression to this that we can use in the co-worker situation is like

54
00:03:18,890 --> 00:03:21,560
this is that is that really necessary.

55
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:26,980
That really necessary so we can actually say is that necessary to express our feeling.

56
00:03:26,990 --> 00:03:32,900
It's the same meaning it's the same meaning when you're doing this what you're doing is you're sticking

57
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:41,470
up for that person to defend someone usually in words is to stick up for them.

58
00:03:41,570 --> 00:03:45,190
If somebody says something bad about your family member what will you do.

59
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:50,350
You'll say hey that's uncalled for as My my brother you're talking about what am I doing.

60
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:52,450
I'm sticking up for my family.

61
00:03:52,460 --> 00:03:56,710
Well maybe I'm sticking up for this person who got fired.

62
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:58,130
They're not even here.

63
00:03:58,130 --> 00:04:05,500
But I'm still sticking up for them because the comment was made behind their back.

64
00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:06,290
They weren't there.

65
00:04:06,290 --> 00:04:07,610
They can't defend themselves.

66
00:04:07,610 --> 00:04:10,140
They didn't hear it the comment was made behind their back.

67
00:04:10,190 --> 00:04:11,780
So I want to stick up for them.

68
00:04:11,810 --> 00:04:17,700
So whenever you defend someone with your words usually you're sticking up for them.

69
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:22,290
You're saying hey no not OK I protect the people behind me.

70
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:27,350
That's the idea anyway very common expression both this one and uncalled for.
