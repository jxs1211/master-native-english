1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:03,550
Now here's a very common situation that you may come across.

2
00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:08,880
You want to do something with a friend but you don't really care what exactly you do.

3
00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:13,850
For example you're going to go out to dinner but where you eat is not important to you right.

4
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:20,040
You're a bit apathetic toward where you're going to go out to eat and you want your friend to choose.

5
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:22,790
You want them to decide OK you don't care.

6
00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:24,480
You could say I don't care.

7
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:25,140
I don't care.

8
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:31,620
But there are a couple of specific expressions that we can use here that can be used to push decisions

9
00:00:31,620 --> 00:00:32,830
to other people.

10
00:00:32,830 --> 00:00:33,230
OK.

11
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:35,640
So let's look at those and these are pretty simple.

12
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:39,170
One friend says Do you want to go out to eat later.

13
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:41,180
Yeah sure that sounds fun.

14
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:42,000
Sounds good.

15
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,520
Any ideas any ideas and it's your call.

16
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:51,710
It's your call see a l l call.

17
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:52,390
Yes.

18
00:00:52,470 --> 00:00:55,380
This call means decision.

19
00:00:55,410 --> 00:00:57,060
This call means decision.

20
00:00:57,090 --> 00:00:58,400
It's your decision.

21
00:00:58,490 --> 00:01:05,070
I'm taking my option to give a decision or to decide I'm giving it to you and whatever you say is what

22
00:01:05,310 --> 00:01:06,140
we will do.

23
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:11,340
So you say let's eat Thai food and I say OK OK I don't care.

24
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:12,080
I don't care.

25
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:13,000
It's your call.

26
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:17,910
It's your call and you can use it for lots of other social situations where you want other people to

27
00:01:17,910 --> 00:01:18,580
decide.

28
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:19,260
It's your call.

29
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:19,860
It's your call.

30
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:20,300
Whatever.

31
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:24,290
Maybe you're going on a vacation and you want to choose where to go on vacation.

32
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:27,630
Lots of different situations you can use it anywhere.

33
00:01:27,660 --> 00:01:34,020
Also you can use up to you to you know up to you could be about a responsibility.

34
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:37,760
It's up to you to make sure that everyone is safe.

35
00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:38,030
OK.

36
00:01:38,030 --> 00:01:39,640
That's your responsibility.

37
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:40,590
So that's OK.

38
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:47,550
But up to you can also mean I'm lifting up the decision and allowing you sort of offering it to you

39
00:01:47,550 --> 00:01:50,010
to choose up to you.

40
00:01:50,010 --> 00:01:53,550
I'm holding it here and you can decide this or this.

41
00:01:53,550 --> 00:01:55,450
Where do you want to go for dinner.

42
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:56,210
Up to you.

43
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:58,060
It's up to you.

44
00:01:58,090 --> 00:01:58,470
OK.

45
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:05,040
You left it up to me to decide where we were going to go on our vacation and I decided that we would

46
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,930
go on a skiing trip.

47
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:12,230
And now you're all complaining to me about choosing to go on a ski trip.

48
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:16,270
So then why did you say it's up to me if you didn't really mean it.

49
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:18,990
If it's really up to me then you can't complain.

50
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:19,280
OK.

51
00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:24,090
So sometimes when people say it's up to you it's not it's not really what they feel.

52
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:30,630
And then later when someone else makes the decision they complain to common common situation that I

53
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:31,210
face.

54
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:31,500
OK.

55
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:34,410
So that's another way to push a decision on others.

56
00:02:34,410 --> 00:02:37,540
And we can also say here whatever whatever.

57
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:39,170
Where do you want to eat whatever.

58
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:46,140
Sort of like saying you choose and you could add whatever is fine whatever is fine whatever is ok whatever

59
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:48,930
is good with me could also say good with me.

60
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:55,320
So these are three very common expressions we can use in many many many many many situations to express

61
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:59,150
the idea of I don't want to decide I'm giving you the decision.

62
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:01,020
Basically that's what these mean.

63
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:01,210
OK.
