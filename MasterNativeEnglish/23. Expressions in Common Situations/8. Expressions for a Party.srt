1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:07,170
One thing about me that's not so good is that I often show up late to social things if there's a party.

2
00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:09,450
I'm often there 20 or 30 minutes late.

3
00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:10,580
I know that's not good.

4
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:16,770
But for some reason I just have a difficult time getting to social things on time.

5
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:24,690
And when that happens there are a few expressions that my friends might use with me to express either

6
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:32,640
that they don't understand why I'm so late or perhaps just to express some impatience some impatience

7
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:36,930
or maybe a little bit of frustration at my lateness.

8
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:38,580
So what could we say here.

9
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:46,010
Well if it's not frustration and I'm late then I just got there and you were worried about me and you

10
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:50,270
maybe are thinking is he going to actually show up is he going to be here.

11
00:00:50,310 --> 00:00:51,630
And then I do when I'm late.

12
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:55,480
OK so someone might say you made it you made it you made it.

13
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:58,040
And that's a happy expression positive.

14
00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:02,430
That's to say you're here you arrived doesn't mean you've actually made something.

15
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:05,520
It means I recognize that you are here.

16
00:01:05,550 --> 00:01:07,270
Hey you made it.

17
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:08,670
It's very positive.

18
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:17,640
OK but but if it's a little bit of frustration that I'm late then someone might say What took you so

19
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:18,450
long.

20
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:21,970
What took you so long.

21
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:27,750
And this can be used in lots of different places lots of different cases lots of different situations

22
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:31,520
where something happens later than it probably should have.

23
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:32,860
Maybe it's a task.

24
00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:40,330
For example I ask you to go and get the umbrella from the other room and it takes you five minutes.

25
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:43,620
You come back five minutes later and I say Hey what what what took so long.

26
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:44,870
What took you so long.

27
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:50,280
I'm expressing a little bit of impatience there or if I show up 30 minutes late to the party and the

28
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:56,070
host is there waiting for me because I'm the one who brought the wine for example and everybody's waiting

29
00:01:56,070 --> 00:01:56,970
for the wine.

30
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,090
Then the host might say What took you so long.

31
00:02:01,110 --> 00:02:02,970
Now that's a rhetorical question.

32
00:02:02,970 --> 00:02:04,910
Remember the meaning of a rhetorical question.

33
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:07,000
It's a question that doesn't really need an answer.

34
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:09,450
I could I could say yes I'm sorry I'm late.

35
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:11,640
We got a little bit stuck in traffic.

36
00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:13,130
That's an excuse.

37
00:02:13,130 --> 00:02:13,420
OK.

38
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:17,070
But this one doesn't actually have to be answered.

39
00:02:17,130 --> 00:02:20,140
We're not actually asking why are you late.

40
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:27,000
It's often just an expression of the feeling of frustration or impatience at my lateness and it can

41
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,940
be used in many many many many many ways.

42
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:32,880
Another one that similar to this is where were you.

43
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:34,740
Where were you.

44
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:35,720
Where were you.

45
00:02:35,730 --> 00:02:38,420
This one is very similar to what took you so long.

46
00:02:38,450 --> 00:02:39,590
But there is a difference.

47
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:44,010
So what's the difference between what took you so long and where were you.

48
00:02:44,010 --> 00:02:46,440
Well if we say where were you.

49
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:54,270
We're talking about being at a place stuck in traffic for example an explanation for not arriving somewhere

50
00:02:54,270 --> 00:02:55,050
on time.

51
00:02:55,050 --> 00:03:03,150
This one is usually specifically for a rival being somewhere whereas this one What took you so long

52
00:03:03,390 --> 00:03:06,660
might be used for other things.

53
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:07,530
What took you so long.

54
00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:09,120
Could be about a task.

55
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:17,850
You didn't finish a task on time an assignment a paper homework so that sort of thing going to get something

56
00:03:17,850 --> 00:03:24,810
for example it could be about maybe response to a question maybe I take 30 seconds to respond to your

57
00:03:24,810 --> 00:03:28,430
question then I say something you could say Well what took you so long.

58
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:36,240
So what took you so long as more general and I would say much more useful in lots of other situations

59
00:03:36,270 --> 00:03:44,280
besides just this party situation whereas that where were you is more specifically related to a rival

60
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:45,260
being there.

61
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:50,580
OK so that's really the difference between them although in this case they're used in the same way.
