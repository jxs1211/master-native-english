1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:06,160
This is a situation that happens to me quite often because I like to go to coffee shops to work.

2
00:00:06,310 --> 00:00:10,640
OK so I go to the coffee shop and I'm working on my computer.

3
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:17,820
And then I need to go to the bathroom but if I take my computer with me to the bathroom then I might

4
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:18,500
lose my seat.

5
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:19,830
Maybe I have a very good seat.

6
00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:20,920
Well that's not good.

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,530
But if I leave my computer.

8
00:00:22,530 --> 00:00:24,370
Well then maybe it will be stolen.

9
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:25,380
It will be stolen.

10
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:26,760
I don't want that to happen.

11
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:29,160
Actually recently I had a bicycle stolen.

12
00:00:29,190 --> 00:00:31,870
So it's not fun to have your stuff stolen.

13
00:00:31,930 --> 00:00:32,380
OK.

14
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:36,020
So you look over there and there's a person and they have a computer.

15
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:42,310
So you think they must be pretty reliable reliable and they're probably not going to steal your computer.

16
00:00:42,330 --> 00:00:45,280
You would like them to watch.

17
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:47,340
Look at not all the time.

18
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:52,530
Not like staring but pay attention to your computer while you go to the bathroom.

19
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:53,310
OK.

20
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:54,930
You're going to ask them to do that.

21
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:57,570
This is a common thing to do in America.

22
00:00:57,570 --> 00:00:58,230
Very common.

23
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:01,250
And then you can come back and then you can have your seat back.

24
00:01:01,290 --> 00:01:07,220
Now it is something that we do that requires trust a little bit because you don't know that person.

25
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:10,980
But they seem fairly reliable.

26
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:14,310
It's your judgment it's your judgment that they seem reliable.

27
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:19,620
So you're at a coffee shop and you need to go to the bathroom but your computer is on the table.

28
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:23,190
You see a stranger sitting nearby and they seem fairly reliable.

29
00:01:23,190 --> 00:01:24,690
What can you say.

30
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:29,460
OK now we're going to use a very common expression to go up to this person.

31
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:34,440
I'm going to put it in the situation so I walk up to that person and I say Excuse me.

32
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:36,870
Now I could add here sorry to bother you.

33
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:39,710
Sorry sorry to bother you.

34
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:40,670
Sorry to bother you.

35
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:42,060
You could take this out.

36
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:43,110
You could take this up.

37
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:44,900
You could say just sorry to bother you.

38
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:46,290
You could say hi there.

39
00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:47,570
Sorry to bother you.

40
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:49,710
There are a lot of different ways that you could begin.

41
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:56,090
Excuse me is a very common thing to say in general to a stranger when you want to say something to them.

42
00:01:56,460 --> 00:02:01,650
Excuse me is a great way to if you need to talk to somebody you don't know to begin that whatever it

43
00:02:01,650 --> 00:02:02,990
is you need to say excuse me.

44
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,910
Sorry to bother you could you could you.

45
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:07,210
Now here's the expression.

46
00:02:07,230 --> 00:02:21,670
Keep an eye on my computer while I go to the bathroom and you could add then I'll be back in a minute.

47
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:23,010
Back means you'll return.

48
00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:24,630
I'll be back in a minute.

49
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:27,000
I'll be right back or I'll.

50
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:28,650
We could say also.

51
00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:33,050
I'll I'll just be a minute.

52
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:33,800
I'll just be a minute.

53
00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:34,760
I'll just be a minute.

54
00:02:34,770 --> 00:02:37,710
So this is a very common thing to say in this situation.

55
00:02:37,710 --> 00:02:42,320
There are other things you could say but keep an eye on is the is the useful expression here.

56
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:46,010
Excuse me sorry to bother you could you keep an eye on my computer.

57
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:47,210
Well I go to the bathroom.

58
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:48,240
I'll just be a minute.

59
00:02:48,270 --> 00:02:48,940
I'll just be a minute.

60
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,580
Or would you mind.

61
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:54,690
Would you mind keeping if you use would you mind then we can say keeping.

62
00:02:54,690 --> 00:02:56,410
But it's the same expression.

63
00:02:56,430 --> 00:03:00,000
Would you mind keeping an eye on my computer while I go to the bathroom.

64
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:01,430
I'll be back in a minute.

65
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:04,870
I'll be back in a couple of minutes and they'll probably say yes sure.

66
00:03:05,010 --> 00:03:06,430
Yeah sure sure.

67
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:07,170
No problem.

68
00:03:07,170 --> 00:03:07,530
All right.

69
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:08,520
OK fine.

70
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:09,310
That's OK.

71
00:03:09,330 --> 00:03:13,830
Then when you come back you have to because your computer is over there.

72
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:14,760
Don't do nothing.

73
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:19,670
You'll have to do something it's sort of polite it's unspoken rule when you come back.

74
00:03:19,710 --> 00:03:24,510
You look at them if they're far enough away you don't have to actually shout across the coffee shop

75
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,240
things like that.

76
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:28,500
You can just say thank you.

77
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:31,090
Like that and whisper it to yourself.

78
00:03:31,230 --> 00:03:36,940
Wave like that and say then you have acknowledged that they did something for you.

79
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:39,930
You don't need to go over to them and say thank you very much for helping me.

80
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:41,080
Here's my business card.

81
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:45,570
It's a little too much because it's a very simple common thing.

82
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:46,770
This expression.

83
00:03:46,770 --> 00:03:50,870
Keep an eye on can be used in lots of other ways.

84
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:55,260
Now if I'm watching the computer does it really mean that that person has one eye on their computer

85
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:57,390
and one eye on my computer.

86
00:03:57,390 --> 00:03:57,750
No.

87
00:03:57,810 --> 00:04:02,210
Doesn't mean that what it means is they're paying attention to it.

88
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:04,530
They're not looking at it every moment that I'm gone.

89
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:10,890
They're just paying attention so we can use it to mean to pay attention to something or to care about

90
00:04:10,890 --> 00:04:12,230
the condition of something.

91
00:04:12,690 --> 00:04:18,180
So we could use keep an eye on for example for children for a week maybe for example going on vacation.

92
00:04:18,210 --> 00:04:25,590
I have a young child and I ask my my mother do you think you could keep an eye on Joseph for the week.

93
00:04:25,590 --> 00:04:26,550
Well we're on vacation.

94
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:28,020
Could you keep an eye on him.

95
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:32,750
Well that means could you could you let him come over and live with you and take care of him.

96
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:36,210
But keep an eye on means to care about that thing or pay attention to it.

97
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:39,620
We could also use it for for example a price.

98
00:04:39,630 --> 00:04:45,000
You know prices go up and down for things and maybe we want to buy something but we're waiting for that

99
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,230
thing to be cheap enough.

100
00:04:46,230 --> 00:04:49,590
The price is too high right now waiting for it to go down.

101
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:57,090
I'm keeping an eye on the price of the latest iPhone when it gets low enough.

102
00:04:57,090 --> 00:04:58,130
I'm going to buy it.

103
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:58,740
I'll buy it.

104
00:04:59,070 --> 00:05:01,070
I'm going to get it I'm going to get it.

105
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,130
And keeping an eye on the price.

106
00:05:03,140 --> 00:05:07,400
The prices are not at not exactly a real thing is it goes up and down.

107
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:10,490
So that's the thing I'm paying attention to.

108
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:11,110
OK.

109
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:16,610
There's a really useful expression and it can be used in all kinds of different situations for physical

110
00:05:16,610 --> 00:05:20,720
things and non physical things non-physical things.

111
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,900
I'm keeping my eye on you.

112
00:05:22,910 --> 00:05:24,680
That one's a little critical.

113
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,240
I'm keeping my eye on you.

114
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:29,590
That means I may be expected to do something bad.

115
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:30,410
That's OK too.

116
00:05:30,410 --> 00:05:32,770
You can use it in that situation as well.
