1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:03,870
What's the difference between a proposal and an idea.

2
00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:09,720
Well they're not that different but an idea might be something you just kind of throw out there to solve

3
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:16,650
a problem or for any other reason and a proposal is meant to be a little bit more serious and it's usually

4
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:18,570
something that you would prepare for.

5
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:22,140
So a proposal is more like or could be more like a presentation.

6
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:30,120
You might even prepare a PBT a PowerPoint presentation when you discuss a proposal for solving a particular

7
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:30,780
problem.

8
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:35,700
Now let's say the particular problem is that staff members or the whole staff they're just not getting

9
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:36,760
along very well.

10
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:43,750
Maybe there are some issues and disagreements and a lot of you could call it drama maybe coming up every

11
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:47,780
day and maybe this is because they just don't know each other very well.

12
00:00:47,790 --> 00:00:49,670
They don't have a chance to socialize.

13
00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:53,160
And so there's a bit of frustration among the staff.

14
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:58,740
Let's say this is the issue and one person is going to propose a solution to the problem.

15
00:00:58,770 --> 00:00:59,350
OK.

16
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:01,380
And I'm going to just read out this proposal.

17
00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:07,770
I don't want to focus too much on the proposal because really it has the basics or the essentials of

18
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:08,840
giving a presentation.

19
00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:13,660
And we've talked about that before because you could stand up and you could make a little hook.

20
00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:18,140
So you might say What do you think really is the core of this issue.

21
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:24,510
It's pretty clear to me that the core of the issue is that the staff have no chance to socialize and

22
00:01:24,510 --> 00:01:26,270
form bonds with each other.

23
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:29,720
So we've maybe used a bit of a rhetorical question there.

24
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:32,990
Why do you think that we're not asking anybody to answer it right.

25
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:33,860
They're just thinking about it.

26
00:01:33,870 --> 00:01:38,320
So we're using a lot of the basics of the presentation that we learned in another lesson.

27
00:01:38,370 --> 00:01:44,310
So I don't want to focus too much on it but basically I just wanna make it clear that an idea is more

28
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:49,560
casual and a proposal is more formal and often something that you would prepare in advance.

29
00:01:49,650 --> 00:01:50,270
OK.

30
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:58,860
So to the problem of issues with company culture bad morale company morale is low morale is the sort

31
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:05,000
of energy level or level of happiness among the staff.

32
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:08,250
I propose a big monthly dinner for the whole staff.

33
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:14,770
This will promote company culture and boost morale boost means to increase or to make it better.

34
00:02:14,890 --> 00:02:18,590
Then I would probably go into more detail about why I think this is a good idea.

35
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:24,060
Let's say we have a PowerPoint behind us based on the PowerPoint that we have.

36
00:02:24,070 --> 00:02:25,320
It could say for example.

37
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:31,830
So this would be a good investment for us because right now if we have this issue with low morale having

38
00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:38,070
a big company dinner is something we only need to do maybe once a month that can allow the whole staff

39
00:02:38,070 --> 00:02:39,410
to get to know each other better.

40
00:02:39,510 --> 00:02:42,850
Create new bonds in a relaxed setting.

41
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:47,810
And when they can do that when they can have fun with each other then they're going to build trust.

42
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:53,720
And when they build trust those bonds are going to translate back into the workplace.

43
00:02:53,850 --> 00:02:59,980
Then we could go on and we could go through our outline point A point B in Point C with examples.

44
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,760
I don't want to get into the whole thing but basically when you're giving a proposal follow the basic

45
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:09,060
structure of the outline that we learned in the other lesson.
