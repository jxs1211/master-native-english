1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:02,720
Why do we need to actually hold meetings.

2
00:00:02,730 --> 00:00:10,650
Well there can be a huge number of reasons to hold hold a meeting and whether it's a group of people

3
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:13,770
or just two one of those might be in negotiation.

4
00:00:13,770 --> 00:00:20,640
We've talked about that but maybe for example two groups from two different companies might get together

5
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:27,600
to negotiate some very large deal for example and they might discuss terms they might try to compromise

6
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:33,680
or they might decide that they can't come to an agreement and then they at least know why.

7
00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:35,740
Because they had the meeting.

8
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:38,510
Maybe it's a brainstorming meeting.

9
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:41,200
These are in my opinion the most fun.

10
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:48,900
Brainstorming is when everybody is giving ideas often to solve a problem or to come up with something

11
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:51,920
new that people haven't thought of before.

12
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:54,560
Maybe in a company for example.

13
00:00:54,560 --> 00:01:01,740
So let's say there's a problem with one product in this company and that's what they sell.

14
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:06,040
One of the things they sell and it's not working it's not they're not selling a lot of that.

15
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:07,620
They're trying to figure out why.

16
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:09,680
So they get everybody together.

17
00:01:09,870 --> 00:01:19,230
Maybe the people who are responsible for making strategic decisions strategic is the adjective strategy

18
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:27,100
means planning and making decisions about what what can help the company or what can accomplish goals.

19
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:32,790
OK so basically everyone's throwing out ideas when we brainstorm.

20
00:01:32,830 --> 00:01:35,980
There's a storm going on in your brain.

21
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:43,440
We're not usually focused on coming to an agreement about which one we're going to do maybe but the

22
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:46,620
general idea is you say what you think.

23
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:52,890
Then you say then you say and then you say and I'll write it down on the whiteboard and we'll get all

24
00:01:52,890 --> 00:02:00,160
the ideas down or on the board and then we can discuss them and decide which one is best.

25
00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:04,570
But first let's brainstorm and it can be a lot of fun.

26
00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:10,830
And often if you have five or six people in a room together brainstorming that can be really really

27
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:12,210
fun really interesting.

28
00:02:12,210 --> 00:02:22,320
Another reason you might have a meeting is to discuss policy changes now policies are rules within usually

29
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:30,120
an organization or a company and sometimes policy needs to be changed based on something that happened.

30
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:37,620
So let's say there is a new law in the country that this company is in or the state or whatever.

31
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:41,810
And so because of that law the company then needs to make a change.

32
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:48,030
Well they will have a meeting to discuss how the company's rules will change based on that change in

33
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:56,100
the law or perhaps there is a problem that's come up recently could be related to company culture and

34
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:58,700
how employees interact with each other.

35
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:01,230
Or maybe it's related to payment whatever.

36
00:03:01,290 --> 00:03:03,300
Maybe some changes need to happen.

37
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:10,040
These are policy changes and the management staff staff is a group of people by the way.

38
00:03:10,050 --> 00:03:14,700
It's not each person you're not a staff usually you're a staff member.

39
00:03:14,730 --> 00:03:16,520
Each person is a staff member.

40
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:23,010
So the management staff might get together and discuss what policies might need to change in order to

41
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:27,420
resolve the problem or adjust or whatever needs to happen.

42
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:30,150
Something needs to change in the rules of the company.

43
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:39,870
So policy changes so the management staff or the sometimes senior staff may get together to decide what

44
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:47,490
policy changes to make or perhaps if they've already decided how to implement how to implement those

45
00:03:47,490 --> 00:03:48,270
changes.

46
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:52,530
If we implement something that means we put it into place we put it into action.

47
00:03:52,530 --> 00:03:53,690
This is the plan.

48
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:54,440
Okay great.

49
00:03:54,450 --> 00:03:55,310
We have a plan.

50
00:03:55,440 --> 00:04:01,470
Now let's talk about how we implement the plan or how we actually make it real.

51
00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:07,920
How we actually put it into place into place put it into place.

52
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:14,040
Now similar to a brainstorming meeting we might have a problem problem solving meeting.

53
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:16,490
This could be a little bit different than brainstorming.

54
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,400
We know exactly what the problem is.

55
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:20,790
And we're trying to find solutions.

56
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:27,120
Maybe there are only two options so we're not really brainstorming about what to do but we're trying

57
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:35,790
to decide maybe which option is best A or B and maybe we're weighing the pros and cons and having a

58
00:04:35,790 --> 00:04:45,780
discussion about what are the pros more or the cons more we could say for example the the pros outweigh

59
00:04:46,110 --> 00:04:51,150
the cons or we could say the cons outweigh outweigh the pros.

60
00:04:51,150 --> 00:04:52,170
It goes either way.

61
00:04:52,170 --> 00:04:57,360
So in order to figure out whether A is better than B or B is better than a we'll get together and talk

62
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:02,790
about which one is going to be the best in the long term.

63
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:09,810
So if we're talking about long term or short term we're talking about immediate benefits or benefits

64
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:11,220
down the road.

65
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:17,700
In the far future down we sometimes say down the road.

66
00:05:17,790 --> 00:05:23,330
Well I think that I think that a is a good choice but it really only solves the immediate problem.

67
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:25,680
I think B will be better down the road.

68
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:28,840
I think B will be better in the long term.

69
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:31,980
The last one I want to mention is alignment.

70
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:38,490
Now this one might just be for each department in a company each department or maybe each department

71
00:05:38,490 --> 00:05:44,580
head to update everyone else about what's going on in their department.

72
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:51,660
This is just to make sure that everybody is on the same page on the same page.

73
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:53,190
We often use this expression.

74
00:05:53,190 --> 00:05:58,290
We need to make sure we're all on the same page so that decisions I make don't negatively affect decisions

75
00:05:58,290 --> 00:06:04,230
you make so that we can all make the right decisions so that we can move in a direction altogether so

76
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:12,080
that we can have alignment alignment means we are in the same sort of direction all going together right.

77
00:06:12,110 --> 00:06:18,300
I can also say to keep someone in the loop to keep someone in the loop means that they know what's going

78
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:18,920
on.

79
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:25,470
If one person is going to leave for a week and won't be able to maybe take part in any of the meetings

80
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:30,560
he might say to his or she might say to her colleague please keep me in the loop.

81
00:06:30,690 --> 00:06:33,880
That means give me updates let me know what's going on.

82
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:40,080
So maybe once a week there is an alignment meeting an alignment meeting in which everybody just talks

83
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:46,320
about what's going on so that nobody is out of alignment.

84
00:06:46,350 --> 00:06:51,760
Nobody is out of the loop which is a very common phrase as well.

85
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:56,790
All right now we're going to go on and we're going to actually talk about a proposal and how we can

86
00:06:56,790 --> 00:06:59,490
make a proposal in a meeting situation.
