1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:06,780
So far in this lesson we've talked about the reasons we have meetings and we've proposed a very simple

2
00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:10,450
solution to an issue with company culture.

3
00:00:10,470 --> 00:00:12,460
This is the situation.

4
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:15,570
There are five or six people at this meeting.

5
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:19,680
The person in charge of the meeting is called the moderator.

6
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:23,710
Now this could be the boss of these people but not necessarily.

7
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:24,930
Perhaps not.

8
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:26,360
They say all right.

9
00:00:26,370 --> 00:00:32,070
So I've asked each of you to prepare a proposal for this issue that we're talking about today about

10
00:00:32,370 --> 00:00:34,620
morale among the staff.

11
00:00:34,650 --> 00:00:36,640
Larry I'd like you to start.

12
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:40,550
Could you give your proposal about the company dinner.

13
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:46,960
So then Larry stands up and he gives his proposal about the monthly dinner the idea that I just mentioned.

14
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:52,860
Now the other people might have some questions and some feedback once he's given his proposal.

15
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:59,100
Sometimes it will be after Larry finishes with the proposal and sometimes it will be in the middle.

16
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:00,610
They might want to stop him now.

17
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:02,710
That's usually not the best idea.

18
00:01:02,790 --> 00:01:08,580
But there are times when you need to cut in and I'm going to share some basically phrases that you can

19
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:14,790
use when you want to then give feedback on an idea when you want to cut in sometimes or when you want

20
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:16,500
to just offer an opinion.

21
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:18,610
Whether you agree or disagree.

22
00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:26,080
So Larry has given his proposal on the monthly dinner and how he thinks it could solve the issue.

23
00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:28,470
Now there might be a simple questions of course you can.

24
00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:39,030
Once it's over just ask what what costs what costs would be associated with holding the dinner and and

25
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:48,320
who or which department would maybe be responsible which can buy RSP responsible for the budget.

26
00:01:48,330 --> 00:01:51,210
OK so this is just a follow up question.

27
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:52,560
A follow up question.

28
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:55,940
Larry didn't give a lot of detail about the cost involved.

29
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:57,270
So I have a question about that.

30
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:02,280
So this is a good way to often explore something.

31
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:07,580
And if you disagree with somebody make them realize that their suggestion is maybe not great.

32
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:12,890
I'm not saying Larry suggestion is bad but for example I think it's way too expensive.

33
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:15,900
And instead of saying I disagree I think it's too expensive.

34
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:18,860
Instead I say what costs would be involved.

35
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:24,720
And then Larry has to answer the question and maybe when he answers the question maybe he realizes that

36
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:26,460
it's too expensive.

37
00:02:26,490 --> 00:02:33,000
So one way of disagreeing is making the person who suggested the idea realize that there's something

38
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,850
about their idea that's not realistic.

39
00:02:35,850 --> 00:02:36,920
That's one way to do it.

40
00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:43,680
Now maybe you just use this question what costs would be associated or involved and also say involved

41
00:02:43,770 --> 00:02:45,180
with holding the dinner.

42
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:50,550
Maybe we just want to know maybe we're not actually trying to criticize maybe we're not trying to say

43
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:52,480
I disagree but that's OK too.

44
00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:56,370
This is very simple and asking these sorts of questions is very important.

45
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:02,300
So you can just once the person is finished talking ask these simple follow on or follow up questions

46
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:09,210
but what if we want to stop Larry in the middle of his proposal in the middle of his presentation about

47
00:03:09,210 --> 00:03:10,480
this this idea.

48
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:16,680
Well then we can use a couple of expressions we could use if I may if I may.

49
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:28,380
We can use if if I can cut in for a second or we could say moment and if we really wanted to we could

50
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:31,280
say hold on a moment.

51
00:03:31,350 --> 00:03:37,650
Hold on a moment and then we say our opinion now that one could be considered a little bit rude to say

52
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:42,990
hold on a moment because it's like saying wait stop talking I need to say something and it's urgent.

53
00:03:42,990 --> 00:03:47,970
Generally you want to give feedback in a meeting after but if it's really really important to say it

54
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,130
now then you can use these phrases.

55
00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:58,500
So let's look at examples for each of these if I may I would like to say that the cost isn't justified.

56
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:02,590
I don't think I don't think it's worth it.

57
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:04,880
OK.

58
00:04:05,110 --> 00:04:13,030
Now then we can start to have a conversation about that point or maybe Larry can continue with his presentation

59
00:04:13,030 --> 00:04:14,930
and then we can talk about that after.

60
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:16,570
But I use if I may if I may.

61
00:04:16,570 --> 00:04:20,930
I don't think that the cost is really justifiable.

62
00:04:20,950 --> 00:04:26,000
It's pretty expensive to hold a monthly dinner is it really going to be worth it.

63
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:32,490
I think the cost might outweigh outweigh the advantages of holding a monthly dinner like that.

64
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:36,550
So that's a way to get in there to cut in and stop it.

65
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:43,240
The other one then is if I can cut in if I can cut in I think there might be other ways to boost morale

66
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:45,480
without breaking the bank.

67
00:04:45,610 --> 00:04:46,630
Such as.

68
00:04:46,630 --> 00:04:54,780
And then we could say the idea such as some for example team building exercises during working hours.

69
00:04:54,890 --> 00:04:55,810
That would be a lot cheaper.

70
00:04:55,810 --> 00:05:04,000
All we have to do is hire a trainer or someone who does team building exercises for example.

71
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:04,550
OK.

72
00:05:04,690 --> 00:05:12,530
If I can cut in or we could say if I can just cut in again.

73
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:13,700
It's an interruption.

74
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:15,230
Another way to suggest this.

75
00:05:15,230 --> 00:05:16,460
Hold on for a moment.

76
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:17,510
I mentioned before.

77
00:05:17,510 --> 00:05:18,260
Hold on for a moment.

78
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:28,520
I don't quite see how a meal is the best way to address address here means deal with deal with address

79
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:28,990
this.

80
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:31,980
Each person would be at a small table.

81
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:39,260
That means for example if the reason for this proposal is to make everybody talk with other people and

82
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:42,350
create bonds or connections between them.

83
00:05:42,350 --> 00:05:47,470
Well if you're sitting with four or five other people is there really a huge benefit right.

84
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:54,280
Maybe if there's a way to get everybody to really do something together maybe that would be a lot better.

85
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:54,600
OK.

86
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:57,160
So this person again disagrees.

87
00:05:57,170 --> 00:06:00,060
I don't quite see how a meal.

88
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:02,970
OK now this is a very gentle way.

89
00:06:02,990 --> 00:06:06,020
So hold on for a moment is not super polite.

90
00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:09,570
This could be considered a bit rude if it's an interruption.

91
00:06:09,630 --> 00:06:10,340
On for a moment.

92
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:11,490
Hold on for a moment.

93
00:06:11,630 --> 00:06:16,850
But then this I don't quite see how what you said is correct.

94
00:06:16,850 --> 00:06:23,240
I don't quite see how what you're saying makes sense is a very soft and gentle way to communicate the

95
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:25,950
idea that you completely disagree.

96
00:06:26,090 --> 00:06:35,390
Again adding quite quite makes it a lot softer if you say I completely disagree then that's a lot more

97
00:06:35,390 --> 00:06:35,960
direct.

98
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:36,670
OK.

99
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:40,480
So anytime you want to softly or gently disagree.

100
00:06:40,490 --> 00:06:41,620
Use this.

101
00:06:41,630 --> 00:06:47,360
I don't quite see how that would work or I don't quite agree.

102
00:06:47,390 --> 00:06:56,450
One way to tell somebody you disagree is to create a hypothetical possibility that if it's put into

103
00:06:56,450 --> 00:06:59,290
place there would be some negative result.

104
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:00,790
So you can say it like that.

105
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:05,480
Let's say his Larry's presentation is over it has ended right.

106
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:10,180
He's done with his proposal now and I don't agree with it.

107
00:07:10,210 --> 00:07:10,880
OK.

108
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:28,490
So I could say if we did that if we did that it would completely destroy our events budget one meaning

109
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:32,840
of budget is an amount of money that you have for a specific purpose.

110
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:36,520
It's there for events things that happen within the company.

111
00:07:36,530 --> 00:07:37,810
So if we did this every month.

112
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:41,100
Well then we're not going to have any money for anything else.

113
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:45,320
So if we did that hypothetical if we did that it would.

114
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:52,000
Can we use wood when we want to create a hypothetical non real situation hypothetical.

115
00:07:52,310 --> 00:07:57,880
And it's a really powerful way to disagree because we're stating a fact.

116
00:07:57,890 --> 00:08:05,270
What we think is a fact that would happen if this specific plan is put into action.

117
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:11,690
So it's actually very powerful it can be very powerful if you use it well create that hypothetical and

118
00:08:11,690 --> 00:08:16,280
make everyone else realize Oh yeah wow we would have no money for anything else.

119
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:17,610
That sounds terrible.

120
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:22,790
And then if we really wanted to add it we could add it to any of these disagreements we could just say

121
00:08:22,790 --> 00:08:24,250
I don't think it makes sense.

122
00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:29,800
I don't I don't think it makes sense.

123
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:35,320
Whenever somebody gives you an idea about what they think should be done generally we can use.

124
00:08:35,330 --> 00:08:38,710
I don't think it makes sense or it doesn't make sense.

125
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:45,010
It's a great way to disagree but then usually you have to explain why it doesn't make sense.

126
00:08:45,050 --> 00:08:50,020
Now maybe you're thinking wait a second everything you've said so far is to disagree.

127
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:55,140
Well that's because it's very easy to agree if you agree then you can just say yeah I agree.

128
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:57,320
Or you could say great idea.

129
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:58,820
Brilliant proposal.

130
00:08:59,000 --> 00:08:59,720
I like it.

131
00:08:59,780 --> 00:09:03,050
But then you could maybe mention one specific issue.

132
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:08,070
I like it but do we have enough money for this just to ask the question.

133
00:09:08,150 --> 00:09:09,440
Let's do it let's do it.

134
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:11,870
Great idea let's do it.

135
00:09:11,870 --> 00:09:13,790
I think it's perfect.

136
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:15,020
I think it's a great plan.

137
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:21,950
So it's very easy to agree with a proposal and then ask a follow up question about some of the details.

138
00:09:22,010 --> 00:09:24,530
It's a little bit more complicated to disagree.

139
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:31,490
So I hope these phrases that we've learned about how to respond and give feedback based on our proposal

140
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:34,510
are clear because they're all very very common.

141
00:09:34,580 --> 00:09:40,460
And most of them can be used in many many other situations as well outside of just meetings.
