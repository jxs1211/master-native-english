1
00:00:04,020 --> 00:00:09,690
In the last lesson we focused on how to book a hotel room on the phone.

2
00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:15,250
In this lesson we're going to talk about meetings how to handle meetings in English.

3
00:00:15,270 --> 00:00:20,920
Now we're going to focus first on why we have meetings the function the purpose of meetings.

4
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:27,090
Then we're gonna go into proposals how to make a proposal and then for the other people listening to

5
00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:28,270
a proposal.

6
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:31,250
How to give feedback and give comments.

7
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:34,730
Then we're going to actually go into for the person running a meeting.

8
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:41,550
Different things you can say to keep the meeting focused because that's one of the things you need to

9
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:43,580
do as a moderator.

10
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:48,540
The moderator is usually the person who's responsible for the meeting.

11
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:56,040
So meetings are of course for many different things and meetings could be with one person meetings could

12
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:57,400
be with a group of people.

13
00:00:57,450 --> 00:01:01,680
I should be very clear at the beginning we're not going to cover every aspect of meetings.

14
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:10,200
We could probably do a full course just on meetings and the relationships between people in the office

15
00:01:10,450 --> 00:01:10,810
right.

16
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:13,640
We could maybe do another course on that in the future.

17
00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:19,920
But in this class we're going to really try to cover the most important elements of the typical meeting

18
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:21,170
with a group of people.

19
00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:27,010
We won't really focus on the one to one type of meeting because that's really just a conversation.

20
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:34,770
But you should be prepared for this because we did our presentations class before and a proposal is

21
00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:38,060
just a type of presentation so let's get started.

22
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:43,050
And just quickly go over some of the reasons that we need to have meetings.
