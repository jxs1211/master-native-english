00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:04,340
So far in this lesson we've talked about why we hold meetings.

2
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:11,160
We've talked about basically giving a proposal and how it's different from just throwing in an idea

3
00:00:11,430 --> 00:00:17,030
and then how to respond to proposals or ideas from other people in a meeting.

4
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:19,320
Now what if we're actually the moderator of the meeting.

5
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:26,210
This means the person who's in charge of the meeting doesn't necessarily mean the boss but someone who's

6
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:29,240
responsible for keeping the meeting going.

7
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:37,590
Well the primary responsibility the main job of this person is to make sure that things don't get out

8
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:40,830
of control out of hand or off track.

9
00:00:40,830 --> 00:00:46,770
We often use the phrase off track to say that things are going in the wrong direction.

10
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:51,100
We're supposed to be focused on topic A but now we're talking about this.

11
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:53,110
And well it's a problem.

12
00:00:53,110 --> 00:00:58,930
OK so the moderator is responsible for making sure that doesn't happen.

13
00:00:58,950 --> 00:01:01,970
Also making sure people are not fighting or disagreeing.

14
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:08,940
Also making sure that maybe the meeting finishes on time making sure maybe the ideas are on the whiteboard.

15
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:12,860
If there is a whiteboard or on the blackboard if there's a blackboard.

16
00:01:12,870 --> 00:01:17,010
But I haven't ever seen a meeting on a blackboard before.

17
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:20,570
But anyway they're responsible for orchestrating.

18
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:22,040
We could say the whole thing.

19
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:29,490
And I want to talk about a few phrases we can use a few things we can say to keep things focused.

20
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:35,010
So what I want to do is just share with you a few things that the moderator might say to make sure that

21
00:01:35,010 --> 00:01:40,230
the meeting doesn't get off track doesn't stray from the purpose.

22
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:47,820
Here's an example Larry has given his proposal about the monthly dinner and let's say Nathan disagrees.

23
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:49,470
He thinks it costs too much money.

24
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:55,730
Then Lisa here's Nathan's idea that it cost too much money and then she starts talking about the budget.

25
00:01:55,830 --> 00:02:01,260
And she says yeah actually I'm thinking maybe we should increase the budget for events because if we

26
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:03,710
had a bigger budget than we could afford.

27
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:04,500
Blah blah blah.

28
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:05,250
Blah blah blah.

29
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:08,610
OK so now things are getting off track right.

30
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:09,650
This is not good.

31
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:16,560
We're not talking about proposals for resolving the issues that we have with morale.

32
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,230
That's what we're trying to talk about here.

33
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:22,190
So the moderator Linda whoever says good point.

34
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:24,540
But let's stick to the plan for today's meeting.

35
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:27,630
So it's a good way to make her feel.

36
00:02:27,690 --> 00:02:29,310
Hey your ideas not bad.

37
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:30,660
What you're saying is not crazy.

38
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:31,460
That's fine.

39
00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:34,960
Let's stick to the plan for today's meeting.

40
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:36,830
And you're bringing her back.

41
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:38,710
It's a way to say hey hey come back.

42
00:02:38,710 --> 00:02:45,270
Remember we're talking about something else but it's not insulting you're not hurting her feelings by

43
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:46,410
saying it that way.

44
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:51,190
We were about to go off on a tangent about the budget.

45
00:02:51,390 --> 00:02:55,160
Maybe we were about to go off on a tangent off track.

46
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:59,400
But thank goodness our moderator is able to deal with that.

47
00:02:59,400 --> 00:02:59,900
Good point.

48
00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:02,060
But let's stick to the plan for today's meeting.

49
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:07,090
We need to stay focused or we won't get out of here by 6:00.

50
00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:07,880
OK.

51
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:11,380
Now the moderator is from mining everybody.

52
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:16,500
The reason to stay focused and everybody is suddenly realizing Oh right.

53
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:22,020
If we don't stay focused then we'll have to be here until we resolve this issue and we might have to

54
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:26,170
work overtime and maybe I want to go home on time today.

55
00:03:26,190 --> 00:03:32,550
So the moderator is also providing everybody at the meeting with a little bit of a motivation sort of

56
00:03:32,550 --> 00:03:39,900
like a treat we could call it maybe a carrot as something to push them to drive them to stay focused

57
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:41,370
and stay on track.

58
00:03:41,370 --> 00:03:45,870
It's actually a really good way to manage the situation.

59
00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:51,630
Another way to express this I think we're getting a little off track now this is like saying a bit.

60
00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:53,790
Remember we use a bit to soften things.

61
00:03:53,850 --> 00:03:55,510
I think we're getting a little off track.

62
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:57,450
Let's not focus on the budget.

63
00:03:57,450 --> 00:04:01,560
We're supposed to be talking about ways to promote the company culture.

64
00:04:02,490 --> 00:04:03,750
Let's focus.

65
00:04:03,790 --> 00:04:06,080
So this is pretty much the same right.

66
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:12,480
Same basic function the same basic idea almost the same phrasing says a slightly different way of saying

67
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:15,040
this a little makes it gentler.

68
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:15,500
OK.

69
00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:18,540
But we're still stating the reality very clearly.

70
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:22,260
We're supposed to be talking about ways to promote the company culture.

71
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:24,620
Let's focus now.

72
00:04:24,690 --> 00:04:29,170
This is balanced between tough and gentle.

73
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:30,720
The words are gentle.

74
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,460
The meaning is tough.

75
00:04:32,610 --> 00:04:37,250
If you say to everybody hey stop talking about the budget what's wrong with you people.

76
00:04:37,530 --> 00:04:38,120
You call them.

77
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:42,670
I don't know stupid or you say things very directly sometimes.

78
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:49,770
Some people like to communicate that way whatever but sometimes that can make you come across as maybe

79
00:04:49,770 --> 00:04:51,040
too strict.

80
00:04:51,210 --> 00:04:53,450
And it can make other people shut down.

81
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:57,170
They don't want to share their opinions anymore because they don't want to get yelled at.

82
00:04:57,180 --> 00:05:05,980
So they'll just be quiet by saying things in a soft way but with a tough and direct meaning we're able

83
00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:13,060
to make sure that everybody is on track and people are contributing because they feel like they're also

84
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:13,990
respected.

85
00:05:13,990 --> 00:05:17,890
So this is another good one but it is pretty much the same as the previous one.

86
00:05:17,890 --> 00:05:23,380
Finally if we are the moderator of the meeting and we're trying to get things back on track we might

87
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:25,180
say I think it's a good point.

88
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:27,200
So Linda says something about the budget.

89
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:28,450
We should increase the budget.

90
00:05:28,450 --> 00:05:29,950
We need more money for events.

91
00:05:29,950 --> 00:05:31,210
I think it's a good point.

92
00:05:31,210 --> 00:05:35,110
So we've recognized her and her idea.

93
00:05:35,110 --> 00:05:38,180
We haven't shut her down stop talking about that.

94
00:05:38,290 --> 00:05:39,430
Maybe we'll shut her down.

95
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:41,020
That's a good point.

96
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:43,590
Makes her feel maybe good about herself right.

97
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:44,630
So that's great.

98
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:46,630
But again it's off topic.

99
00:05:46,630 --> 00:05:49,420
So after we've given someone a compliment.

100
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:54,160
We then need to say something a little more directly to help people focus.

101
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:56,190
This is often how we give feedback as well.

102
00:05:56,200 --> 00:06:02,380
When you want to give someone feedback one method is called the sandwich method that has other names

103
00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:05,330
too I like the sandwich method because it's very visual.

104
00:06:05,350 --> 00:06:07,830
Say something positive and encouraging.

105
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:14,230
Then you say the meat of the idea really what you're trying to communicate and then maybe another bun

106
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:19,960
of the burger or a sandwich which is another gentle and soft thing but really it's the meat that you

107
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:20,890
want to communicate.

108
00:06:20,890 --> 00:06:25,590
So I think it's a good point but it doesn't quite fit with our plan for today.

109
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:28,630
Why don't we deal with that in the next meeting.

110
00:06:28,690 --> 00:06:30,790
So that's the bottom of the sandwich.

111
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:35,520
The bottom of the sandwich is hey your idea is a wonderful thing to talk about.

112
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:40,530
But if we talk about it in the next meeting then we're still able to stay on track for today.

113
00:06:40,540 --> 00:06:43,950
Then we can deal with today's issue and the budget issue.

114
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:46,680
Maybe tomorrow it's a win win.

115
00:06:46,780 --> 00:06:52,900
So the first part the top of the sandwich is this the real meat of it is this doesn't quite fit with

116
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:54,100
the plan for today.

117
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:57,460
And then the bottom of the sandwich is this and you can do it.

118
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:01,930
If you're moderating a meeting to make people focus on something right.

119
00:07:02,230 --> 00:07:06,620
Say something positive and encouraging then the meat.

120
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:11,880
The real thing you want to communicate then the bottom bun of the burger.

121
00:07:11,950 --> 00:07:13,690
Why don't we deal with that in the next meeting.

122
00:07:13,690 --> 00:07:15,200
That's how good your idea is.

123
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:17,110
It's worth talking about later.

124
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:17,760
OK.

125
00:07:17,890 --> 00:07:21,400
And I really like to use this when I give people feedback.

126
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:24,520
I like to give direct and honest feedback sometimes very critical.

127
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:27,670
But if I say it's terrible directly they feel hurt.

128
00:07:27,670 --> 00:07:35,110
Maybe they don't want to ask me next time but if I use the sandwich method if I use this structure then

129
00:07:35,230 --> 00:07:37,030
I can communicate my idea.

130
00:07:37,090 --> 00:07:41,420
But at the same time make the other person feel like I respect them enough.

131
00:07:41,470 --> 00:07:45,550
And of course you've got to try to be honest it may be a good idea.

132
00:07:45,890 --> 00:07:46,170
OK.

133
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:51,790
So those are some common ways that when you're moderating a meeting you can make sure that things don't

134
00:07:51,790 --> 00:07:53,020
go off track.

135
00:07:53,020 --> 00:07:58,990
You can keep things focused and I hope even though we didn't cover every possible thing that can happen

136
00:07:58,990 --> 00:08:02,590
in a meeting that could be done in a whole course of meetings probably.

137
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:08,770
I hope that you feel more comfortable with how you can communicate in these specific areas particularly

138
00:08:08,950 --> 00:08:16,550
proposals giving feedback on proposals and moderating a meeting and keeping things on track.

139
00:08:16,590 --> 00:08:16,880
OK.

140
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:24,400
So to practice this what I'd like you to do is come up with another idea for helping boost the morale

141
00:08:24,460 --> 00:08:26,090
of this company.

142
00:08:26,090 --> 00:08:28,380
OK imagine you're doing it in a meeting.

143
00:08:28,390 --> 00:08:35,060
Do it until you can say your proposal or speak your proposal naturally record yourself.

144
00:08:35,310 --> 00:08:40,390
OK if you do it three or four times go back and listen to it and try to make corrections and revisions

145
00:08:40,390 --> 00:08:44,790
each time then give some critical feedback on the idea.

146
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:49,100
EXPRESS What's wrong with the idea as though you were another person in the meeting.

147
00:08:49,270 --> 00:08:55,680
Practice this a few times until you feel comfortable doing both the presentation and the feedback.

148
00:08:55,690 --> 00:08:58,590
Good luck and I will see you in the next lesson.
