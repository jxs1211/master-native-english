1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:02,730
So let's say now we're at a speaking event.

2
00:00:02,730 --> 00:00:09,120
We've gone to an event where there will be a speaker talking about some topic or maybe there will be

3
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:12,990
several speakers or perhaps it's a conference.

4
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:18,030
Several days several speakers a lot of different meetings things like that.

5
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:26,300
OK so someone's going to give a talk and it's a well-known person let's say his name is Francis Kane.

6
00:00:26,740 --> 00:00:28,230
I'm making this up.

7
00:00:28,350 --> 00:00:28,560
All right.

8
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:30,870
So friends Cain is going to give a talk.

9
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:32,600
If your name is Francis Cain.

10
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:33,570
That is insane.

11
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:37,090
You must have communicated to me in the past.

12
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:43,950
So how do you know the speaker if this were hanging out maybe before the talk hanging out before this

13
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:45,300
person's presentation.

14
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:48,750
Maybe I'll have a beer or maybe it's this kind of relaxed event.

15
00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:49,830
I've got a beer.

16
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:51,120
This could be called a mixer.

17
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:57,630
Sometimes there are mixers where you have a presentation and also the opportunity to mix with other

18
00:00:57,630 --> 00:00:58,080
people.

19
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:01,530
Well that's the perfect opportunity to start conversations.

20
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:03,930
That's kind of what mixers are for.

21
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:04,170
Right.

22
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:04,470
OK.

23
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:06,410
So how do you know the speaker.

24
00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:09,660
Actually I worked with him several years ago.

25
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:10,980
He was my boss.

26
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:14,250
So the speaker maybe is fairly well-known person.

27
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:15,720
Now we have a lot to talk about.

28
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:20,290
Or actually I watched a couple of his lectures on YouTube.

29
00:01:20,370 --> 00:01:22,550
So I wanted to come to see him speak.

30
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:23,710
How do you know the speaker.

31
00:01:23,730 --> 00:01:25,770
Actually I'm not familiar with the speaker.

32
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:27,180
What's he going to talk about.

33
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:28,470
I'm just here for the mixer.

34
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:33,900
So doesn't matter what the answer is even if they don't know the speaker then they can say something

35
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:36,090
else that you can grab on to.

36
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:42,540
I'm just here for the mixer than I can say Oh actually the speaker is going to be talking about or I

37
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:47,430
could maybe ask some other question about why they wanted to come here for the mixer.

38
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:50,400
I could say Oh so what company are you with.

39
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:50,660
Right.

40
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:55,620
My follow up question What company are you with.

41
00:01:55,650 --> 00:02:01,110
Then people can talk about the company that they represent or if they don't represent a company and

42
00:02:01,110 --> 00:02:02,650
they're there by themselves.

43
00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:04,440
Well that's also interesting.

44
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:07,970
So again it's not too important what question it is.

45
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:15,330
As long as it's related to the situation or contextual and hopefully a little bit interesting.

46
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:21,930
Again the goal of the question should be to get the other person to want to say something they shouldn't

47
00:02:21,930 --> 00:02:23,490
have to struggle to say something.

48
00:02:23,490 --> 00:02:25,340
Now we could also make comments.

49
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:26,160
I like your hat.

50
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:27,210
Did you make that.

51
00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:29,010
This is a question and a comment.

52
00:02:29,010 --> 00:02:32,640
Maybe someone is wearing a I don't know a really cool fedora.

53
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,230
Maybe they're wearing a fedora.

54
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:39,600
And you don't usually see a person wearing a fedora at conference.

55
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:41,010
So you say I like your hat.

56
00:02:41,010 --> 00:02:41,820
Very simple.

57
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:42,450
Did you make it.

58
00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:44,150
Maybe it looks kind of messy.

59
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:46,130
Then they probably want to talk about it.

60
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:51,090
If somebody is going to wear something that's a little different than everybody else wearing a hat at

61
00:02:51,090 --> 00:02:53,750
a conference they might want to talk about it.

62
00:02:53,790 --> 00:03:00,360
I realize that question seems a little silly but it's something and at least I can see if that person

63
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:02,970
wants to have a conversation or not.

64
00:03:02,970 --> 00:03:05,780
And it is showing interest in them.

65
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:08,960
It's showing that hey I noticed something about you.

66
00:03:09,110 --> 00:03:14,820
It could even be somebodies shoes or the way that somebody is standing maybe they're standing by themselves.

67
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:18,430
And I could say hey we why are you standing by yourself.

68
00:03:18,450 --> 00:03:19,410
This is a mixer.

69
00:03:19,470 --> 00:03:19,740
Right.

70
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:23,940
And then they could say Oh well I you know I'm just not really in a good mood or whatever.

71
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:25,710
Again notice something.

72
00:03:25,710 --> 00:03:27,000
Notice something about them.

73
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,680
Don't make it all about you.

74
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:29,950
Make it about them.

75
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:31,490
Make a comment about them.

76
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:37,950
Make a comment about the situation that you share and then you can judge to see if they would like to

77
00:03:37,950 --> 00:03:39,750
talk to you or not.

78
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:45,540
This one is just a regular comment that we could make about the situation not about you not about me.

79
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:52,650
I'm surprised so many people showed up here on a Tuesday or maybe it's Tuesday afternoon and you expect

80
00:03:52,650 --> 00:03:55,510
people to be at work or at school.

81
00:03:55,650 --> 00:04:02,030
And so it's kind of unexpected that this place would be so busy so full this event but maybe the speaker

82
00:04:02,030 --> 00:04:02,970
is very popular.

83
00:04:02,970 --> 00:04:06,780
So the other person could say well you know the speaker is very popular.

84
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:08,810
He's got a lot of fans on YouTube.

85
00:04:08,850 --> 00:04:10,350
So makes sense to me.

86
00:04:10,410 --> 00:04:10,750
Yeah.

87
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:13,440
I didn't actually know he had so many fans on YouTube.

88
00:04:13,530 --> 00:04:16,340
Actually I haven't seen any of his YouTube videos.

89
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:17,040
Really.

90
00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:22,310
You should really watch them because he's got some really great videos whatever you want to say the

91
00:04:22,350 --> 00:04:25,280
conversation then can continue from there.

92
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:29,810
You may notice that at no point have I said my name is Luke.

93
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:30,260
Hello.

94
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:30,900
Nice to meet you.

95
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:31,980
My name is Luke.

96
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:38,340
Usually you shouldn't begin a conversation this way if you walk up to someone who you don't know and

97
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:39,160
you say hello there.

98
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:40,390
My name is Luke.

99
00:04:40,470 --> 00:04:43,260
It's odd it's awkward it's strange.

100
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:48,150
So when should you say it when should you say your name when should you introduce yourself.

101
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:51,750
That can be very quick and it's not really a big deal.

102
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:57,000
Maybe you make a comment or ask a simple question as we've been talking about.

103
00:04:57,030 --> 00:05:04,750
And then at some point after a minute or two into the conversation you say by the way by the way I'm

104
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:05,580
Luke.

105
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:09,410
And if you just say that they'll probably say Oh and I'm Kathy.

106
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:13,860
Whatever the other person's name is you could say what's your name.

107
00:05:14,590 --> 00:05:16,020
But if you start with that.

108
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:16,980
It's quite awkward.

109
00:05:16,990 --> 00:05:21,120
And then it's hard to get a conversation going from there.

110
00:05:21,130 --> 00:05:25,860
Now you could use very general questions like What company do you represent.

111
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:32,790
But my recommendation is to first think what you have in common and then come up with the good common.

112
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:33,850
Good question.

113
00:05:33,850 --> 00:05:36,400
Then everything else should be pretty easy.

114
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:38,430
The conversation should flow.

115
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:42,770
And after a while you can say by the way my name is Luke.

116
00:05:42,770 --> 00:05:44,080
So that's pretty easy right.

117
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:50,620
So we've learned the techniques for getting conversations started with people that we don't know we

118
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:53,040
need to look at the situation itself.

119
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:55,030
Think about what we share with others.

120
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:56,140
Ask good questions.

121
00:05:56,140 --> 00:05:57,840
Make interesting comments.

122
00:05:57,880 --> 00:05:59,920
Pay attention to body language.

123
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:01,450
To practice this.

124
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:04,630
What I'd like you to do is look at this situation.

125
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:05,910
The first day of work.

126
00:06:06,070 --> 00:06:12,820
It's kind of similar to the first day of school one and come up with three to five questions that would

127
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:16,780
be good to ask somebody in this situation.

128
00:06:16,810 --> 00:06:18,690
Maybe it's not their first day of work.

129
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:25,390
It's just your first day of work so you might be talking to somebody who's been working here for a while.

130
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:28,250
Be a new person in the office.

131
00:06:28,540 --> 00:06:34,180
OK three to five questions and then ask yourself the questions or ask somebody else the questions a

132
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:39,500
friend and practice and see if these questions help get the conversation started.

133
00:06:39,550 --> 00:06:46,240
Again the questions should be contextual should be interesting and should make the other person want

134
00:06:46,270 --> 00:06:48,430
to say something back.

135
00:06:48,430 --> 00:06:50,580
Want to explain themselves.

136
00:06:50,590 --> 00:06:52,400
Want to talk about something.

137
00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:59,230
This is the key to having natural conversations with people you just met.

138
00:06:59,230 --> 00:06:59,800
Good luck.
