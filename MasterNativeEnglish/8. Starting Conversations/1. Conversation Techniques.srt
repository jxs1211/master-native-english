1
00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:10,130
In the last lesson we talked about how to describe your routine how to talk about what you do.

2
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:16,710
Usually on a normal day and also how to talk about your responsibilities.

3
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:22,910
In this lesson we're going to be talking about how to start a conversation.

4
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:30,460
You're probably taking this course because you want to learn how to have conversations with other people.

5
00:00:30,470 --> 00:00:35,970
Maybe native English speakers in work situations or maybe in your daily life.

6
00:00:35,970 --> 00:00:41,870
So this class will focus on how we begin those conversations naturally.

7
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:44,120
It's actually not as hard as you may think.

8
00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:52,050
Once you get started in a conversation it's pretty easy to keep it going but getting started in a conversation

9
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:53,280
can be difficult.

10
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:57,490
If you don't know what you're doing or how to do it.

11
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:00,020
So that's what this class is all about.

12
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:05,490
We're going to talk about some techniques for doing it and then as we always do we're going to look

13
00:01:05,490 --> 00:01:11,370
at a couple of real life examples so that you can deeply get the feeling for it so that when you go

14
00:01:11,370 --> 00:01:15,330
out there to have conversations it'll be easy.

15
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:23,250
Tip number one for having conversations is whenever you find yourself in a situation with other people

16
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:31,290
and you'd like to start a conversation you first have to realize what situation you're in.

17
00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:37,650
You may have learned that talking about the weather is always a good way to begin talking with somebody

18
00:01:37,910 --> 00:01:38,310
right.

19
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,140
It's pretty hot these days isn't it.

20
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:46,070
This is the traditional way that many English language learners are taught to begin conversations.

21
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:55,560
Oh it's it's pretty hot today but this is a little bit awkward and doesn't work in every situation.

22
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:57,140
How about this weather.

23
00:01:57,210 --> 00:02:03,930
These are sort of the traditional things what you can do instead is pay careful attention to what the

24
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:11,910
situation is and when you do that you will see what you share with the other person the person you want

25
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:19,440
to talk with and when you realize what you share with that person you'll be able to pick out a good

26
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:26,790
question that is natural that can make that person want to say something or pick out a good comment

27
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:31,850
to say to the other person that will make them want to talk with you right.

28
00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:33,600
So focus on where you are.

29
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:36,330
Are you at a doctor's office.

30
00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:37,950
Are you in the park.

31
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:40,350
Are you in a class.

32
00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:42,550
Are you in your workplace.

33
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:47,640
What things do you have in common with that person.

34
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:52,440
Then how can you make a comment or a question based on that.

35
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:58,290
Now sometimes the thing that you have in common is not the whole situation itself but something the

36
00:02:58,290 --> 00:03:01,680
other person is doing or wearing right.

37
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:07,050
For example if you like skateboarding and you see another person skateboarding obviously that's the

38
00:03:07,050 --> 00:03:13,140
thing that you should use to begin a conversation but it could also be what somebody is wearing maybe

39
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:17,330
a watch and you know something about watches and you can use that.

40
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:20,750
We'll look at examples of how to do that later on.

41
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:26,340
So these are the two questions I ask myself before I start a conversation with somebody and I'm thinking

42
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:29,070
about how to begin what to say right.

43
00:03:29,070 --> 00:03:38,640
That first difficult thing whether it's a comment or question what situation are we in.

44
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:49,020
What do we have in common whatever you come up with then after you ask yourself these questions can

45
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:56,880
then be the basic idea that you use to make a comment or ask a question to the person you want to start

46
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:58,850
a conversation with.

47
00:03:58,890 --> 00:04:06,690
If you ask a question that comes out of nowhere and it's just a shot in the dark do you like basketball

48
00:04:06,870 --> 00:04:14,190
then it's likely probable that the person you asked that question too will feel uncomfortable awkward

49
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:21,450
awkward but if it is really an interesting question that focuses on what is shared between you then

50
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:26,310
that person will feel interested in what you asked and will want to talk.

51
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:31,460
Make it your goal to say something that makes the other person want to say something back.

52
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:35,490
If you're doing all the hard work then it's not really a conversation.

53
00:04:35,490 --> 00:04:42,080
So for example a lot of people send me messages on on WeChat right.

54
00:04:42,090 --> 00:04:47,800
I'm always on on WeChat which has a it's like Facebook messenger if you don't know it.

55
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:52,840
And they often say for example or how long have you been using WeChat.

56
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:53,280
Well that's it.

57
00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:59,340
That's a pretty good question because that's the first time they've connected with me on WeChat and

58
00:04:59,670 --> 00:05:01,380
it's something we both have in common.

59
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:04,350
Hey we both use WeChat so it's an interesting question.

60
00:05:04,350 --> 00:05:06,490
It makes me want to answer it.

61
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:13,380
So maybe if somebody has seen one of my other courses or video and messages me we can use the fact that

62
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:17,190
we don't know each other to ask interesting questions like.

63
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:18,800
Which city do you live in.

64
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:21,340
And then we can ask more questions about that.

65
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:28,380
The thing we have in common is that we don't know physically where the other person is because maybe

66
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:35,130
we're contacting on WeChat sometimes email because we don't know that that can be the thing that we

67
00:05:35,130 --> 00:05:35,870
share.

68
00:05:35,910 --> 00:05:38,190
So that can be the interesting question.

69
00:05:38,190 --> 00:05:39,730
Which city do you live in.

70
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:41,220
Which country do you live in.

71
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:42,220
Where are you from.

72
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:45,960
And we use the same basic idea to make comments.

73
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:51,870
Again if somebody's messages me who I've never talked to before maybe because they saw a video or maybe

74
00:05:51,870 --> 00:06:00,750
saw one of my courses they might say for example you've probably seen so many different kinds of incorrect

75
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:03,710
English which is absolutely right.

76
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:09,780
And then I'll say yes absolutely and then maybe I'll want to share a funny story that one is not based

77
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:17,430
on where we are it's based on something that we share which is that maybe I've taught languages and

78
00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:19,290
your learning languages.

79
00:06:19,290 --> 00:06:26,310
So messaging me using that thing that we share and making a comment about what may be true about my

80
00:06:26,310 --> 00:06:32,580
life and about me even if it's wrong is a good start because if it's not right at least I can correct

81
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:32,790
you.

82
00:06:32,790 --> 00:06:37,250
And that can be that could be an interesting beginning point as well.

83
00:06:37,350 --> 00:06:42,740
When you're starting a conversation it's very important to judge body language.

84
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:48,150
There are times when you're going to maybe start a conversation and the other person doesn't want to

85
00:06:48,150 --> 00:06:48,870
talk to you.

86
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:56,220
You need to be able to notice that and let it go and accept that maybe this time it's not working okay.

87
00:06:56,280 --> 00:07:01,260
And it's the same if somebody is trying to talk with you and you're not in the mood or you're thinking

88
00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:06,480
about something else or you're busy on your phone you'll show that with your body language what you

89
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:10,600
do with your body what you do with your face your facial expression maybe.

90
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:18,450
So if people show impatience or if they seem like they're maybe a bit distracted or if they give very

91
00:07:18,450 --> 00:07:26,370
short answers it's probably best to move on and maybe talk to somebody else because they're probably

92
00:07:26,370 --> 00:07:33,810
trying to show you or signal hey not really in the mood for a conversation now or I just I don't really

93
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:35,510
want want to talk.

94
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:37,230
It's not always rude right.

95
00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:43,290
But sometimes people just don't really want to have a conversation and that's OK so you have to be able

96
00:07:43,290 --> 00:07:50,220
to pay attention to people's reactions to their faces and see if they're interested genuinely in talking

97
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:51,730
with you or not.

98
00:07:51,990 --> 00:07:54,730
If not don't try to force it.

99
00:07:54,810 --> 00:07:55,800
Not a good idea.
