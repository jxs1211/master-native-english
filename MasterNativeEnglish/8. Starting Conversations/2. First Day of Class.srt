1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:06,360
So now we've looked at three basic techniques that you need to pay careful attention to the situation

2
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:09,320
you're in or find what you have in common.

3
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:17,160
Then you need to ask interesting insightful questions or make interesting insightful comments so that

4
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:19,080
the other person wants to speak with you.

5
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:22,980
And you also need to pay careful attention to body language.

6
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:25,580
Now let's actually look at some examples.

7
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:27,960
First the first day of class.

8
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:32,470
Let's say let's imagine if I say let's say it means for example.

9
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:40,350
OK so let's say your first day of class you're a university student you're a freshman freshman by the

10
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:40,500
way.

11
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:47,220
The other three years of university if you don't know freshman and then year two is sophomore then Junior

12
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:51,340
and Senior sure many of you already already know that.

13
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:56,660
Let's say there's another student sitting beside me I feel nervous.

14
00:00:56,660 --> 00:01:02,490
So my first lecture in college in university what's the shared situation here.

15
00:01:02,490 --> 00:01:07,500
Well everybody in this lecture hall we're all students right.

16
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:13,010
We're all students and this is probably all of our first lecture probably.

17
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:14,810
So we have a lot in common.

18
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:15,840
We share a lot.

19
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:16,520
Right.

20
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:17,430
So that's great.

21
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:19,830
We have many things that we could talk about.

22
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:22,540
Here are a couple a couple of examples.

23
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:28,500
And these are by no means the only things that you could say but I turned to the student sitting next

24
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:28,890
to me.

25
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:30,250
I don't know this person.

26
00:01:30,310 --> 00:01:33,700
OK I'm going to try to begin a conversation.

27
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:37,670
How much homework do you think we're going to get on the first day.

28
00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:40,600
How much homework do you think we're gonna get on the first day.

29
00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:46,820
I could say going to get but I'll probably say Can I get going to get going.

30
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:50,880
Now they might just say I don't know body language.

31
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:55,860
That means probably they don't want to talk to me and maybe they say I don't think that he's going to

32
00:01:55,860 --> 00:02:01,850
give us any homework on the first on the first lecture because what could there be homework on.

33
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:08,460
We're probably just going to go over the course the course syllabus syllabus the overview for the whole

34
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:09,860
course.

35
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:10,980
Yeah I hope so.

36
00:02:10,980 --> 00:02:11,220
OK.

37
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:12,730
So we've started something.

38
00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:13,110
Right.

39
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:13,560
OK.

40
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:18,080
That's one way we could say are you a chemistry major too.

41
00:02:18,210 --> 00:02:23,970
So if we're in maybe a basic biology class maybe a basic chemistry class whatever but there are a lot

42
00:02:23,970 --> 00:02:30,390
of chemistry students here chemistry majors may right be right that again that's really messy.

43
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:34,310
C h e m i s t r y.

44
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:37,520
OK so are you a chemistry major too.

45
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:38,700
I'm a chemistry major.

46
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:40,370
That's what that means.

47
00:02:40,370 --> 00:02:40,880
OK.

48
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:46,910
And it doesn't matter if I'm right or wrong if he says I know that I can say oh what Major are you on

49
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:49,080
a biology major.

50
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:49,940
OK.

51
00:02:50,130 --> 00:02:51,300
Now we've started something.

52
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:57,360
So why have you decided to take this professors biology class instead of Professor Jones.

53
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:03,280
Because I heard that this professor is actually really good and kind of relaxed about exams.

54
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:05,390
Yeah I heard the same thing.

55
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:06,990
We've started a conversation.

56
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:08,310
OK.

57
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:09,830
Are you a chemistry major.

58
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:10,720
Yes I am.

59
00:03:10,770 --> 00:03:11,520
Cool.

60
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:12,690
Me too.

61
00:03:12,690 --> 00:03:13,010
All right.

62
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:14,990
Now we really have something in common.

63
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,040
Why are you studying chemistry.

64
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:22,530
I'm studying chemistry because someday I'd like to be a pharmacist.

65
00:03:22,530 --> 00:03:24,360
Whatever conversation.

66
00:03:24,610 --> 00:03:25,200
OK.

67
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:26,630
The beginning part.

68
00:03:26,730 --> 00:03:33,690
All we have to do is get that beginning question if it's interesting enough that person shows that they're

69
00:03:33,690 --> 00:03:34,960
willing to talk with us.

70
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:41,880
They would like to talk with us by saying a little bit more that we can then grab on to an ad to or

71
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:48,360
if they say yeah I don't know then we can see hey they don't want to talk to me and that's just fine

72
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:48,830
right.

73
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:49,440
OK.

74
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:55,830
I heard this professor speaks really fast maybe it's before the professor even came into the lecture

75
00:03:55,830 --> 00:03:56,320
hall.

76
00:03:56,370 --> 00:03:58,470
I heard this professor speaks really fast.

77
00:03:58,470 --> 00:04:03,450
I hope that I'll be able to take enough notes because I don't want to fail my exams.

78
00:04:03,450 --> 00:04:09,480
You could just say this I heard this professor speaks really fast then the other student says Actually

79
00:04:09,690 --> 00:04:16,410
Actually he does speak really fast but if you look back there they're recording all of the lectures

80
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:20,940
so you can actually download the lectures after class.

81
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:21,170
Wow.

82
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:21,780
That's great.

83
00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:24,360
So if I need to I can download it and listen again.

84
00:04:24,450 --> 00:04:25,350
If I missed something.

85
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:26,450
Yeah that's awesome.

86
00:04:26,450 --> 00:04:26,810
All right.

87
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:31,920
Once again we've started a conversation that has to be an OK question.

88
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:34,100
It doesn't have to be an amazing question.

89
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:38,260
But if you turn to that person and say How about this weather.

90
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:40,080
That sounds very silly right.

91
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,040
It sounds stupid.

92
00:04:41,070 --> 00:04:43,170
It's not related to the situation.

93
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:49,590
We say Do you like movies awkward strange connected to the situation.

94
00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:50,430
Let's look at another.
