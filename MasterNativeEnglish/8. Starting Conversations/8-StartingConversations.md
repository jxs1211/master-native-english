#### First day of work in workplace:
- How much work do you think we're gonna take on the first day?
   You don't need to rush to into working on some specific task. First of all, I think you should getting to be familiar with our project, like team, product, the way we work and etc.
- Are you a Computer Science major? Yes, I'm Comupter Science major.
- I heard the leader speak really lots of tasks we need to take. Yes, indeed.

#### At an event:
- How do you know the root cause?
- I like your monitor tool. It seems really easy to use.Did you make that?
- I’m surprised so many people don't wear mask here day to day(on a daily basis).

#### Homework:
Come up with three questions to use at ‘the first day of work’. Ask yourself
or another person the questions and see if they get the conversation
started naturally.


- Could you how can I login into the website? You could just use your working email address to get a random code to login, and modify the password any time.
- What kind of IDE do you use on a daily basis? I like Vscode which is from Microsoft.
- Why so many people don't come to office on a Monday? Because we have a policy that all the stuff on the Online Services team would work from home on Monday and Friday.
