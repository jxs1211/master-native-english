1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:06,380
So now that we know the phrases to use to describe a routine we can actually get into it.

2
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:08,780
We can actually look at it in real life.

3
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:08,900
OK.

4
00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:14,390
This is not my daily routine just so you know it's not real but it's like a real one.

5
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:15,010
OK.

6
00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:24,450
I usually get up at six thirty a.m. We don't have to say and wash my face and brush my teeth brush my

7
00:00:24,450 --> 00:00:26,850
teeth OK.

8
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:30,930
My workplace is far away from from my home.

9
00:00:30,950 --> 00:00:37,010
So it takes me about an hour takes me about an hour to get there by subway.

10
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:40,940
Could say an hour to get there on foot an hour to get there by bicycle.

11
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:41,500
Whatever.

12
00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:46,950
I don't have time to make breakfast myself I don't have time to actually sit down and make it to make

13
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:48,600
breakfast myself typically.

14
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:54,110
But luckily sounds a little weird typically and luckily but they're used very differently so it's OK.

15
00:00:54,120 --> 00:01:00,240
But luckily there is a really good convenience store on the way to the subway a convenience store as

16
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:08,910
a little shop that maybe sells snacks sandwiches drinks coffee on the way to the subway so I can grab

17
00:01:08,910 --> 00:01:10,930
a sandwich or something.

18
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:13,260
Maybe it's a sandwich or something else.

19
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:15,940
That means probably it's usually a sandwich.

20
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:16,570
Ok.

21
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:20,180
I get to my office by around 730.

22
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:24,090
So again we have by around here that means probably before or.

23
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:32,760
Up to and then 730 maybe it's 720 maybe it's 725 which is before the rest of the staff the staff has

24
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:34,400
everybody in the company.

25
00:01:34,450 --> 00:01:34,620
Right.

26
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:36,000
It's called the staff.

27
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,100
A staff member or staff member one of the staff.

28
00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:47,790
So the staff is this whole group of people who work at the company because work doesn't actually start

29
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:49,110
until 8:00.

30
00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:51,110
I've got free time to relax.

31
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:52,680
So what does work mean here.

32
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:59,050
Well this place must have some sort of rule that says everybody has to begin at 8:00.

33
00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:06,150
OK maybe there's a punch in clock punch in means that you actually need to push a button or scan a card

34
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:10,210
or tap your finger on something to begin your work hours.

35
00:02:10,230 --> 00:02:15,150
Maybe you're paid by the hour an hourly wage so that's when work starts.

36
00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:22,910
So I've got 30 minutes I've got free time to relax have a cup of tea and watch videos or read.

37
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:30,060
So this is a pretty normal routine of somebody who's getting ready for the day getting dressed washing

38
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:32,880
their face and then going to work pretty normal.

39
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:37,320
It helps me center myself before the busy day ahead.

40
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:44,820
What is center myself mean so to center yourself means to calm down to keep your mind quiet to relax

41
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:49,230
a little bit so that you're able to deal with maybe stress pressure.

42
00:02:49,230 --> 00:02:53,180
Stress is usually something that's inside a feeling that we have inside.

43
00:02:53,250 --> 00:03:00,510
I have so much stress pressure is usually from the outside giving me a lot of pressure everybody around

44
00:03:00,510 --> 00:03:05,740
me is giving me so much pressure so I feel a lot of stress.

45
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:12,450
I feel stressed OK so centering myself watching some videos relax tea.

46
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:16,570
OK so then I need to start my daily responsibilities.

47
00:03:16,570 --> 00:03:16,990
OK.

48
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:23,400
I am in charge of making sure that everyone in the office has a checklist.

49
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:28,890
We know the phrase I'm in charge of making sure everybody who works here needs to have a list.

50
00:03:28,950 --> 00:03:31,370
You need to do this this this this and this.

51
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:35,370
And when you finish it you need to check it off.

52
00:03:35,370 --> 00:03:41,790
That's why it's called a check list a checklist of things to finish by the end of the day before the

53
00:03:41,790 --> 00:03:47,880
end of the day if the day means for example from 8:00 if it starts exactly at 8:00.

54
00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:54,660
If it's a very strict office and everybody has to punch in at 8:00 and then finish at maybe five or

55
00:03:54,870 --> 00:03:58,690
six or whatever that is when work finishes.

56
00:03:58,710 --> 00:04:01,370
That is the end of the day.

57
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:01,580
OK.

58
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:05,530
So that means before or up to that time.

59
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:05,840
OK.

60
00:04:05,910 --> 00:04:12,930
I also need to I also need to send out e-mails to different departments to remind them of monthly events

61
00:04:13,290 --> 00:04:15,140
and various deadlines.

62
00:04:15,170 --> 00:04:15,420
OK.

63
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:18,630
So to remind somebody is to help them remember.

64
00:04:18,780 --> 00:04:24,180
I'm just reminding you I'm reminding you that we have an appointment tomorrow.

65
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:27,750
I'm reminding you that we have a meeting tomorrow so please don't forget.

66
00:04:28,050 --> 00:04:33,270
Oh that reminds me I need to buy some chocolate at the store.

67
00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:35,450
Thank you for reminding me.

68
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:36,860
Thank you for reminding me.

69
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:40,710
It's different than remember to remind us something outside.

70
00:04:40,710 --> 00:04:45,850
Another thing makes you remember something that reminds you or a person reminds you.

71
00:04:45,850 --> 00:04:46,150
OK.

72
00:04:46,190 --> 00:04:49,140
I also need to send out e-mails to different departments.

73
00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:52,690
Departments are the different groups within a company.

74
00:04:52,710 --> 00:04:58,640
I mentioned H.R. before a normal company may have H.R. human resources.

75
00:04:58,650 --> 00:04:59,480
They might have.

76
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:06,960
Administration they might have maybe a purchasing department many different types of departments nowadays

77
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:14,520
a lot of companies have maybe a social media department or of course a marketing department to advertise

78
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:16,760
to customers or clients.

79
00:05:16,770 --> 00:05:22,680
So there are a lot of different types of departments of monthly events and various deadlines remember

80
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:29,230
deadlines are things we need to finish the deadline is the time the deadline is tomorrow.

81
00:05:29,230 --> 00:05:30,500
Tomorrow is the deadline.

82
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:32,260
We have to finish before tomorrow.

83
00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:33,210
Various means.

84
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:40,030
It doesn't matter which ones we're not really focusing on which deadlines we use the word various right

85
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:41,670
various articles.

86
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:48,350
Just read some some various articles on the Internet various deadlines various ideas.

87
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:54,250
We're not really focused on which ones and the idea is that they're all a bit different.

88
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:55,540
That's what various means.

89
00:05:55,570 --> 00:05:57,380
I'm usually done with that.

90
00:05:57,400 --> 00:06:04,240
That means the stuff I just mentioned all of my responsibilities by 11:00 which is about lunchtime it's

91
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:10,180
about lunch time since there is no cafeteria in the building cafeteria is the place where everybody

92
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:12,550
eats at a school or at an office.

93
00:06:12,550 --> 00:06:18,970
Since there is no cafeteria in the building I go out to a restaurant near or nearby the office.

94
00:06:19,330 --> 00:06:21,810
Everybody gets a one hour lunch break.

95
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:23,590
Remember one half an hour.

96
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:26,710
We can make an adjective gets a one hour lunch break.

97
00:06:26,710 --> 00:06:29,860
Honestly I prefer eating alone.

98
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:31,210
My personal feeling.

99
00:06:31,210 --> 00:06:33,970
We often begin this kind of sentence with honestly.

100
00:06:34,150 --> 00:06:35,670
Honestly I prefer eating alone.

101
00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:41,580
But sometimes I eat with some of my colleagues colleagues colleagues.

102
00:06:41,590 --> 00:06:45,160
What's the difference between colleagues and coworkers.

103
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:46,480
There isn't really a difference.

104
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:50,650
Sometimes colleagues might be a little bit higher level right.

105
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:59,470
So maybe business people will talk about their their associates or people they work with as colleagues

106
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:03,900
and maybe co-workers are just people in your office right.

107
00:07:03,910 --> 00:07:07,610
People who work in the same office as you so colleagues.

108
00:07:07,630 --> 00:07:12,870
This word is a bit more general but sometimes I eat with some of my colleagues.

109
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:22,300
If I'm really busy and don't have time for lunch I may just get a snack snack is small amounts of food

110
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:27,520
chips and apple candy bar something very small a snack.

111
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:29,770
Usually we eat that between meals.

112
00:07:29,770 --> 00:07:34,840
It's not a full meal a full meal or a snack full meal snack.

113
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:40,840
It may just get a snack from the vending machine vending machine the machine where you would buy the

114
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:43,580
snacks push the button.

115
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:45,240
Take the snack.

116
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:48,710
I know it's not healthy but you've got to do what you gotta do.

117
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,190
You've got to do what you gotta do.

118
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:54,000
This is a really common phrase you've got to do what you gotta do.

119
00:07:54,010 --> 00:07:55,690
You've got to do what you gotta do.

120
00:07:55,720 --> 00:08:00,670
It basically means that sometimes you can't really choose what you'd really like.

121
00:08:00,670 --> 00:08:04,380
What I'd really like is a nice lunch in a restaurant.

122
00:08:04,450 --> 00:08:07,190
Mexican food by myself.

123
00:08:07,330 --> 00:08:12,620
Listening to maybe a podcast sounds great but I don't have time.

124
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:13,750
I'm too busy today.

125
00:08:13,870 --> 00:08:16,180
So you've got to do what you gotta do.

126
00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:17,950
I don't really have a choice.

127
00:08:17,950 --> 00:08:20,590
You've got to do what you gotta do means what we do.

128
00:08:20,590 --> 00:08:26,890
What we have to do when we don't really have a choice or when somebody is limiting us or when we don't

129
00:08:26,890 --> 00:08:29,670
have enough time or we don't have enough money.

130
00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:32,630
Basically we have no other option.

131
00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:34,600
So we use this phrase.

132
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:42,040
So we've talked about the phrases and the words you can use to describe your routine things you need

133
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:42,730
to do.

134
00:08:42,790 --> 00:08:51,250
How we can explain time and our actions related to time as well as how we describe our responsibilities.

135
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:56,210
Then we looked at an example and now I want you to actually try it yourself.

136
00:08:56,260 --> 00:09:01,510
You should feel pretty comfortable with these words and phrases by now and hopefully you've listened

137
00:09:01,510 --> 00:09:05,020
to or gone through the example a couple times.

138
00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:10,910
Try it describe your routine in as much detail as you can record yourself doing it.

139
00:09:10,930 --> 00:09:12,610
Don't just write it down.

140
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,530
In fact don't write it down at all.

141
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:17,570
Just record yourself describing your routine.

142
00:09:17,590 --> 00:09:21,630
Try to use the words and phrases from this lesson.

143
00:09:21,730 --> 00:09:26,100
Don't copy my example but draw inspiration from it.

144
00:09:26,110 --> 00:09:27,870
Follow the basic structure.

145
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:30,870
Start with your the beginning of your day right.

146
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:37,930
Start with the breakfast maybe and your morning routine then get into work or school and describe some

147
00:09:37,930 --> 00:09:40,540
of your responsibilities in work or school.

148
00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:43,950
That's a pretty good structure to use.

149
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:46,630
Record yourself and then listen to it again.

150
00:09:46,630 --> 00:09:52,150
And if you're not happy with it record yourself doing it again until you're happy with it.

151
00:09:52,150 --> 00:09:57,490
Pick out some of the things that you're saying that maybe sound a little odd until it sounds natural

152
00:09:57,850 --> 00:09:58,960
and smooth.

153
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:01,560
Do it again and again and you'll get used to it.

154
00:10:01,570 --> 00:10:06,430
You'll get comfortable with it and that's how you gain confidence.

155
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:07,050
Go for it.
