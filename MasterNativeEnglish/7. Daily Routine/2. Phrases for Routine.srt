1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:02,350
So we know what a routine is now.

2
00:00:02,370 --> 00:00:05,120
We need to know how to introduce it.

3
00:00:05,140 --> 00:00:10,950
OK so let's talk about how we can do that to start we need to say when things happen.

4
00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:17,160
So very simple here we can just say and we often use the present tense by the way because these are

5
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:22,290
things that didn't only happen before because it's part of your routine.

6
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:24,630
It's stuff that you do often.

7
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:25,160
Right.

8
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:31,980
So we can use the present tense which makes it a lot easier to describe your routine because when you're

9
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:36,270
doing it in the past it can be difficult to remember the past tense.

10
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:36,920
Right.

11
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:38,700
So we can just use the present tense.

12
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:41,190
You don't need to use will either.

13
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:42,780
Just use the present tense.

14
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:50,690
What we often use words of frequency words a frequency like usually sometimes often regularly.

15
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:53,620
I think you probably know most of these words.

16
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:55,850
So let's let's start with time OK.

17
00:00:55,890 --> 00:01:06,600
At 10:00 at 10:00 at 10:00 that's probably going to be 10:00 a.m. If you don't say p.m. or am and the

18
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:11,250
situation makes it pretty clear that you're talking about either morning or evening.

19
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:13,390
It's OK to leave that out.

20
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:19,920
I could say I usually go to bed around 10:00 so that's going to be P.M. I usually get up around 10:00

21
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:27,240
or go to work around 10:00 probably that's going to be a.m. And if it's not then you will say I have

22
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:31,650
a very weird job where I go to work at 10:00 p.m. at night.

23
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:32,370
Right.

24
00:01:32,370 --> 00:01:35,580
You'll say that you'll say p.m. if it's different.

25
00:01:35,610 --> 00:01:38,310
But otherwise we can often leave that out.

26
00:01:38,370 --> 00:01:38,560
OK.

27
00:01:38,580 --> 00:01:47,190
So at 10:00 I usually I usually have a snack and then within that usually maybe there's a sometimes

28
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:55,930
you could say sometimes I have sometimes sometimes I have cookie as a treat.

29
00:01:56,040 --> 00:02:03,600
You could say but more often more often I have some fruit but a cup of fruit if you have a very good

30
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:04,080
diet.

31
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:05,220
Good eating habits.

32
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:05,570
All right.

33
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:08,730
We can use sometimes even though it's inside usually.

34
00:02:08,730 --> 00:02:13,680
Usually you have the snack but when you have this snack sometimes it's a cookie.

35
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,480
More often it's fruit.

36
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:19,850
If you're a healthy healthy person don't eat too many cookies you'll get fat.

37
00:02:19,850 --> 00:02:20,940
They'll want to do that.

38
00:02:20,970 --> 00:02:22,820
That is no good.

39
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:23,270
OK.

40
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:29,040
We could also say when we do things in order to help keep things in order.

41
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:29,310
Right.

42
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:36,960
A routine is usually this followed by this followed by this this this this this this this this we don't

43
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:43,590
always want to use the time because that can start to feel repetitive can start to feel like it's repeating

44
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:44,290
too much.

45
00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:49,860
We can instead use after that after that after that.

46
00:02:49,860 --> 00:03:00,120
So you could say for example after that I often I often check you check my email or I often respond

47
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:04,380
to some emails that would be a pretty typical thing to do after a snack.

48
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:09,030
You don't need to say after my snack because we just said that we had a snack.

49
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:09,890
I have a snack.

50
00:03:09,930 --> 00:03:15,300
Usually at 10 after that after the snack is over I usually check my emails.

51
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:20,280
And then you can say maybe where you check them if you want to mention where it happens you could say

52
00:03:20,490 --> 00:03:23,040
at that my my desk.

53
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:27,450
But you don't have to say at my desk because that might be maybe obvious.

54
00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:33,180
Maybe it's kind of obvious that you check e-mails at your desk so you can add details or not.

55
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:39,660
Sometimes in the routine there's something that happens if this happens but maybe this doesn't happen.

56
00:03:39,690 --> 00:03:50,520
So then we can introduce it like this if if I don't take the bus if I don't take the bus I usually remember

57
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:54,960
the pronunciation of usually is you use.

58
00:03:55,050 --> 00:03:58,070
Usually I usually walk.

59
00:03:58,140 --> 00:03:59,460
So instead of driving.

60
00:03:59,460 --> 00:03:59,750
Right.

61
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:07,020
This kind of suggests that you do usually take the bus but there are times when you don't and when you

62
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:10,410
don't you usually walk don't let that confuse you.

63
00:04:10,410 --> 00:04:12,540
Just because I say I usually walk.

64
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:14,970
That doesn't mean I usually walk.

65
00:04:14,970 --> 00:04:24,730
I usually walk when I don't take the bus so maybe I take the bus this often like 90 percent of the time.

66
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:25,950
This is the bus.

67
00:04:26,010 --> 00:04:29,670
But maybe maybe these are the times when I missed the bus.

68
00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:29,970
Right.

69
00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:30,720
The bus left.

70
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:31,650
I missed it.

71
00:04:31,650 --> 00:04:34,090
And so what do I do in these times.

72
00:04:34,110 --> 00:04:39,750
Now forget about the first usually forget about how often that happens.

73
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:42,580
Now we're only talking about this period of time.

74
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:49,690
I usually walk or I usually drive my car or I usually take a taxi so that's OK to do.

75
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:52,310
In fact that's a very common thing to do.

76
00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:58,740
But to be clear sometimes our actions depend on whether or not things happen that are completely out

77
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:02,660
of our control if if it rains.

78
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:03,150
OK.

79
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:04,820
So what do you do when it rains.

80
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:10,030
If it rains I take a taxi and you can do this for everything.

81
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:18,190
When you're describing what you're doing usually or on a regular basis on a regular on a regular basis

82
00:05:18,430 --> 00:05:20,490
then you can use this basic structure.

83
00:05:20,530 --> 00:05:25,120
If this I do this and it can be a choice that you make if I.

84
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:27,210
And then what happens after that.

85
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:33,490
Or it could be something out of your control something that just happens if it rains.

86
00:05:33,490 --> 00:05:41,770
There are times when maybe if isn't the best phrase to use because we want to focus on the fact that

87
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:48,010
every single time this happens I do this or we do this.

88
00:05:48,010 --> 00:05:56,830
So there we can use whenever whenever focus is on every time before we said if it rains right.

89
00:05:56,830 --> 00:06:06,880
Maybe I do this maybe I do this whenever means every time whenever my boss is out of the office maybe

90
00:06:06,910 --> 00:06:08,750
he's on a business trip right.

91
00:06:08,770 --> 00:06:17,920
Whenever my boss is out of the office everyone in my department wants something silly brings beer to

92
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:23,380
work brings beer brings beer whatever you want to say.

93
00:06:23,470 --> 00:06:27,100
But the point is that it happens every time this happens.

94
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:31,510
That doesn't mean your boss is always gone every time your boss is gone.

95
00:06:31,510 --> 00:06:33,400
You bring beer to the office.

96
00:06:33,430 --> 00:06:37,610
One of the things that's part of a normal professional day.

97
00:06:37,660 --> 00:06:43,440
If you're a student then maybe you would just say lunch or sometimes your lunch period right.

98
00:06:43,450 --> 00:06:46,540
Lunch is the time when you eat lunch right.

99
00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:53,190
Or if you're at an office worker or you have a job where you need to have or keep regular hours.

100
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:56,260
You might say my lunch break.

101
00:06:56,290 --> 00:07:01,840
This is the special time during the day when you can stop working and take lunch or eat lunch.

102
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:06,520
It doesn't mean that you actually eat something although probably you do.

103
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:11,770
The point is it's this specific time set aside for you to do that.

104
00:07:11,850 --> 00:07:16,510
So maybe you have a one hour lunch break or a 30 minute lunch break.

105
00:07:16,510 --> 00:07:18,040
I'm on my lunch break.

106
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:23,470
People will say I'm on my lunch break.

107
00:07:23,530 --> 00:07:27,040
Hey look can you could you please talk to this client.

108
00:07:27,090 --> 00:07:28,540
We're you know we really need.

109
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:29,440
We really need your help.

110
00:07:30,910 --> 00:07:31,770
Oh I can't.

111
00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:35,250
I'm on my lunch break.

112
00:07:35,590 --> 00:07:37,580
I would be a terrible office worker.

113
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:39,730
I would be an awful co-worker.

114
00:07:39,730 --> 00:07:45,550
I think typically after my lunch break I have a few meetings.

115
00:07:45,610 --> 00:07:49,640
Typically after my lunch break I have a few meetings.

116
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:50,160
OK.

117
00:07:50,230 --> 00:07:54,310
That means it doesn't happen every time but most of the time it does.

118
00:07:54,310 --> 00:07:58,010
In fact you can say most of the time can say most of the time.

119
00:07:58,030 --> 00:08:04,240
Some things are not really strict in time maybe your lunch break is always at twelve from twelve to

120
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:14,770
one twelve to one but often when we get off of work or get out of school we can use around to say that

121
00:08:14,770 --> 00:08:16,650
it happens near that time.

122
00:08:16,690 --> 00:08:24,580
So maybe you have to do some extra work after school every day and you don't leave school until around

123
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:26,530
four thirty pm so OK.

124
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:34,150
You can say that most of the time I get out of school around around four thirty.

125
00:08:34,150 --> 00:08:40,360
And of course that for 30 means p.m. We don't have to say p.m. because nobody gets out of school at

126
00:08:40,370 --> 00:08:41,730
430 am.

127
00:08:41,740 --> 00:08:43,050
That is crazy.

128
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:45,110
Get off work ok.

129
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:46,460
Get off work.

130
00:08:46,530 --> 00:08:59,230
I could say by around by around 5:00 I'm usually ready to go home or by around 5:00 I'm usually done

131
00:08:59,260 --> 00:09:01,870
with my work or by around 5:00.

132
00:09:01,870 --> 00:09:05,850
I usually leave the office by around 5:00.

133
00:09:05,890 --> 00:09:15,310
I usually by around 5:00 I usually leave the office or again get off work Get off of work.

134
00:09:15,310 --> 00:09:20,260
This is a way to say something happens near a time but it's not fixed.

135
00:09:20,530 --> 00:09:27,280
If something is very fixed well then you should just use at I have lunch at 12:00 or I have lunch from

136
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:33,490

137
12:00 to one or if you're a student you could say I get out of school at three thirty.

138
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:39,130
That means it's the same every single day and it happens exactly at three thirty.

139
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:40,240
Exactly then.

140
00:09:40,230 --> 00:09:40,670
OK.

141
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:49,810
There's no flexibility around is near about is near by around is also ok I usually get off around three

142
00:09:49,810 --> 00:09:50,090
thirty.

143
00:09:50,110 --> 00:09:53,700
I usually leave by around three thirty.

144
00:09:53,770 --> 00:10:02,080
That means before three thirty and up to three thirty or if it's specific use at or if it happens between

145
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:07,000
this time and this time we can say from two from twelve to one.
