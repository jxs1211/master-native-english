### Assignment:

Record yourself explaining your typical routine. Don’t forget to mention
specific times, and use as much detail as you can. Remember to use the
phrases from this lesson.


I usually get up at 6:40, wash my face and brush my teeth. My workplace is far away from my home, so it takes me about an hour to get there by subway. I don’t have time to make breakfast myself, typically, but luckily
there is a really good convenience store on the way to the subway, so I can grab a sandwich or something. 
I get to my office by around 8:00,
which is before the rest of the staff. 
Because work doesn’t actually start until 9:30, I’ve got free time to relax, have a cup of tea, and watch videos or
read. 
It helps me center myself before the busy day ahead. 
So, then I need to start my daily responsibilities.
I am in charge of coding feature of the product, and fixing the bugs during the test and user encountered.
And I also need to send out emails to report the monthly cost of the team and remind different teams the various events.
I’m usually done with all that by 12:00, which is just about lunchtime. 
I usually have the lunch I cooked and took to the office, sometimes I grab a bit ordered by meituan.
Since there’s a cafeteria in the building, I usually have a cup of coffee with my colleagues after lunch.
I mainly code and debug the feature for the product all afternoon, I get out of work until 6:00.

I take the subway to the gym where I usually workout. I spend one or two hours in the gym, after that, I go back home by bus, I arrived home around 8:00, and usually after washing my sport clothing, I cook the lunch of next day. After that, I usually have some fun of watching video, or doing some reading, praticing spoken English. Finally, I go to sleep around 11:00.

#### PS
If I don't take the subway, I usually take a bus to the workplace.
I will be terrible office worker.

Tpyically.  we will have a meeting for retro this Spring at the end of the Spring. 

In the team, I'm in charge of coding the backend of the product.

Whenever there are delays, what ever it takes, my job is to push the team to hit the deadline.

It's over my budget.

Now let's now look at an life example of routine to see how we can put things together in a real natrual way.


Everybody gets a 1-hour lunch break.
Honestly, I prefer eating alone, but sometimes I eat with some of my colleagues. If I’m really busy and don’t have time for lunch, I may just get a snack from the vending machine.
I know it’s not healthy, but you gotta do what you gotta do.
