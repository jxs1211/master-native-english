1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:04,700
In life we have responsibilities things that we need to take care of.

2
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:13,110
If you do all of your responsibilities very well then people may say that you're very responsible.

3
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:14,630
That's the kind of person you are.

4
00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:16,430
You're a responsible person.

5
00:00:16,430 --> 00:00:16,910
OK.

6
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:22,710
But what phrases or words can we use to explain our responsibilities to others.

7
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:27,780
Well there are a couple that are very common and I want to go through those because when you're talking

8
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:34,200
about your routine or when you're describing to others what you do or maybe you're telling others what

9
00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:37,740
they need to do you may need to use these phrases.

10
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:37,970
OK.

11
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:41,270
So first one I'm in charge of.

12
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:46,460
And then we could say either a noun or an action and we can use ISG after it.

13
00:00:46,470 --> 00:00:55,710
So we could say I'm in charge of interviews about that son and I eat us interviews in the H R department

14
00:00:56,130 --> 00:01:02,570
H.R. stands for by the way human resources are.

15
00:01:02,620 --> 00:01:04,460
Yes human resources.

16
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:12,810
I'm responsible for interviews in human resources or I'm in charge of interviews in the human resources

17
00:01:13,050 --> 00:01:14,570
or H.R. department.

18
00:01:14,570 --> 00:01:14,990
OK.

19
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:27,510
You could also though say I'm in charge of making sure that we deliver everything on time.

20
00:01:27,510 --> 00:01:35,240
Whatever you're doing you can say making sure I'm in charge of making sure that something happens.

21
00:01:35,370 --> 00:01:36,670
Whatever it is.

22
00:01:36,690 --> 00:01:41,590
So it's a very useful phrase to explain the thing that you need to do.

23
00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:43,490
It's your responsibility.

24
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:45,290
You're in charge of doing.

25
00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:47,130
I Angie that thing.

26
00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:54,460
But we could also say need I'm sure you probably know this one but I need to make sure.

27
00:01:54,510 --> 00:01:56,570
So it's sort of like making sure same thing.

28
00:01:56,580 --> 00:02:05,170
I need to make sure I need to make sure that we follow all the regulations.

29
00:02:05,190 --> 00:02:12,720
Regulations are like rules regulations are like sometimes laws whatever I need to make sure it's the

30
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:17,780
same as saying I'm in charge of making sure you can use either one it doesn't really matter.

31
00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:20,690
I need to make sure that we follow all the regulations.

32
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:25,610
I'm in charge of making sure we follow all the regulations when problems happen.

33
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:32,700
If you're responsible for the action that needs to be taken when that problem happens we can go back

34
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:36,480
to that word that we mentioned before whenever.

35
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:44,910
Again that means every time so we could say whenever there are delays delays means something is not

36
00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:47,100
on time something is a little a little late.

37
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:51,620
Whenever there are delays it's my fault.

38
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:53,520
It's that's an S.

39
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:54,260
Can you imagine.

40
00:02:54,270 --> 00:03:08,050
That's an s it's my job it's my job to maybe push the team push the team to hit the deadline.

41
00:03:08,130 --> 00:03:10,770
L I N E hit the deadline.

42
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:13,010
OK so here's a team.

43
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:14,570
This team has to do some work.

44
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:17,700
Maybe the team is making a video.

45
00:03:17,710 --> 00:03:18,340
OK.

46
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:22,290
And there are delays because maybe one person is sick.

47
00:03:22,290 --> 00:03:25,080
So the whole team is a little bit late.

48
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:25,810
OK.

49
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:32,880
Whenever there are delays whenever that thing happens for whatever reason whose job is it to deal with

50
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:33,570
this problem.

51
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:39,920
It's my job it's my job I'm responsible for it I'm responsible for making sure we hit the deadline.

52
00:03:40,110 --> 00:03:42,530
I need to make sure we hit the deadline.

53
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:51,320
It's my job to push the team to hit the deadline or we could say to make the deadline.

54
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:58,380
So this is the one that you would use when you want to explain what you're responsible for whenever

55
00:03:58,770 --> 00:04:00,110
X happens.

56
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:06,250
Whatever it is when we're talking about our responsibilities we also need to talk about consequences

57
00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:07,850
consequences.

58
00:04:07,950 --> 00:04:10,270
What happens if something bad happens.

59
00:04:10,290 --> 00:04:12,720
What happens maybe if something good happens.

60
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:15,790
These are consequences the result of something else.

61
00:04:15,830 --> 00:04:16,230
OK.

62
00:04:16,530 --> 00:04:23,550
So let's say if I don't finish don't finish my part.

63
00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:30,060
Maybe everybody has a part let's say it's this video project we're trying to make a video for advertising

64
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:30,960
or whatever.

65
00:04:30,990 --> 00:04:40,380
If I don't finish my part the rest of the team maybe can't go home or the rest of the team has to work

66
00:04:40,410 --> 00:04:46,680
overtime or the rest of the team will have to do my work for me whatever it is we're talking about what

67
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:49,210
happens if this thing happens.

68
00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:51,200
And it could be a good thing or a bad thing.

69
00:04:51,230 --> 00:04:51,880
OK.

70
00:04:51,990 --> 00:04:58,930
Whenever we get an award the whole team gets to go up on stage not just me not just the leader.

71
00:04:58,950 --> 00:05:06,440
So consequent These are the results and we can use this type of sentence this expression to explain

72
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:14,810
the consequences of a specific thing that happens if I don't finish my part my job my responsibility.

73
00:05:14,810 --> 00:05:21,170
Everybody needs to work overtime and then we have to pay everybody overtime and maybe we can't afford

74
00:05:21,290 --> 00:05:21,910
that.

75
00:05:22,010 --> 00:05:28,130
Can't afford something means you don't have enough money to pay for it or you're just not able to pay

76
00:05:28,130 --> 00:05:28,550
for it.

77
00:05:29,270 --> 00:05:30,830
Maybe it's too much for you.

78
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:34,980
We could have used that in the last lesson when we were talking about the apartment.

79
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:39,200
I can't afford one thousand five hundred I can't afford it.

80
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:40,920
It's out of my price range.

81
00:05:40,970 --> 00:05:42,200
It's over my budget.

82
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:48,470
OK so let's now look at a real life example of a routine and how we can put all of these things together

83
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:50,390
in a really natural way.
