1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:05,880
I just want to mention one thing that's part of a routine that's a little bit more personal about our

2
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:07,230
sleeping habits.

3
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:12,440
So if we say that we get up or we wake up Are these the same.

4
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:14,250
Not exactly no.

5
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:21,120
So if you say that you get up that means you get out of bed and maybe you get dressed for the day you

6
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:29,160
get dressed that means you put your clothes on you get dressed or you get ready get ready for the day.

7
00:00:29,190 --> 00:00:29,460
Right.

8
00:00:29,610 --> 00:00:34,030
But if you say you wake up that does not mean that you get up.

9
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:38,130
Getting up is this action getting out of bed getting ready.

10
00:00:38,130 --> 00:00:40,320
Waking up is just opening your eyes.

11
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:47,400
So some people say I usually wake up around eight thirty but I don't get up until 9:00.

12
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:53,730
So maybe from eight thirty until 9:00 you're just I don't know checking your Instagram or whatever you're

13
00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:54,620
doing right.

14
00:00:54,630 --> 00:00:55,390
You wake up.

15
00:00:55,410 --> 00:01:01,470
That means you're not sleeping anymore and then you play around on your phone and then you get up and

16
00:01:01,470 --> 00:01:02,700
get ready for the day.

17
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:05,370
So those are different sleeping in.

18
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:11,860
Does this mean that we go to sleep late or does it mean we sleep for a long time.

19
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:12,050
OK.

20
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:15,950
So sleeping in means we get up very late.

21
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:23,460
Not go to bed late get up late so maybe you usually get up at eight o'clock seven o'clock.

22
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:26,220
But today you slept in.

23
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:31,260
You decided to sleep in until 10 thirty a.m. ten thirty in the morning.

24
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:33,160
Oh I really slept in today.

25
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:35,240
I don't know why I was so sleepy.

26
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:37,080
I slept in.

27
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:40,530
I got up late go to bed go to sleep.

28
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:42,050
Are these the same again.

29
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:43,530
It's kind of like get up.

30
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:50,820
Wake up you could go to bed at 10:00 and then not go to sleep until 12:00 maybe for two hours you're

31
00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:52,050
playing with your phone again.

32
00:01:52,050 --> 00:01:52,500
I don't know.

33
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:59,080
But you don't go to sleep until a certain time you don't close your eyes and maybe until 12:00.

34
00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:02,840
So just to be clear go to bed does not mean go to sleep.

35
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:06,020
But people often say them as the same thing.

36
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:09,560
I'm gonna go to bed that suggests that you're going to go to sleep.

37
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:10,090
Right.

38
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:16,530
But I just want to be clear that you can use them separately if you want to because they're not exactly

39
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:16,940
the same.
