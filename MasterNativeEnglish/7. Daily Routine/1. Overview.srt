1
00:00:03,890 --> 00:00:11,910
In the last lesson we talked very importantly about how to inquire how to get information from people

2
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:14,550
that we don't know especially on the phone.

3
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:20,190
In this lesson we're going to talk about something that's also very important but more personal more

4
00:00:20,190 --> 00:00:21,420
about what we do.

5
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:28,560
We're going to talk about your routine now your routine is what you usually do every day.

6
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:37,410
That's your routine and your routine maybe includes going to work what you do when you get up and maybe

7
00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:38,830
what you do on the weekend.

8
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:46,740
You can have a routine for different kinds of things for example you can say my workout routine you

9
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:55,650
can say my travel routine you can say my weekend routine so in general routine means just what you usually

10
00:00:55,650 --> 00:01:04,590
do unless you say something more specific in front of it like workout routine travel routine work routine

11
00:01:04,740 --> 00:01:08,610
in general routine means what we do on a normal day.

12
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:14,790
We're going to talk about some useful phrases that we can use as well as some important words that we

13
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:21,630
need to know when we're describing what we do our routine and we're going to talk about the things that

14
00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:25,980
we have to do for example at work our responsibilities.

15
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:31,020
How do we introduce our responsibilities when people ask you about yourself.

16
00:01:31,050 --> 00:01:35,400
You need to be able to explain what it is that you do every day right.

17
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:37,040
What is your job exactly.

18
00:01:37,050 --> 00:01:39,570
What do you have to do in your job.

19
00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:42,210
And then finally we're going to look at a real example.

20
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:44,200
We're going to look at a routine.

21
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:45,930
It's gonna be a little bit long.

22
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:52,770
Kind of like a story but hopefully it can give you a feeling for how people will describe the things

23
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:58,410
they have to do on a normal day because it's very important to be able to do that and it often comes

24
00:01:58,410 --> 00:01:59,940
up in conversation.

25
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:01,140
What did you do yesterday.

26
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:04,330
Oh yesterday I blah blah blah blah blah blah blah.

27
00:02:04,470 --> 00:02:08,790
And then you say your routine so let's start with some phrases.
