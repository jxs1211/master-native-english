1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:04,050
What if the Vincents are not from America.

2
00:00:04,050 --> 00:00:07,740
What if they're from England or some other country.

3
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:10,240
Well then we have some other things to deal with.

4
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:20,040
So let's say that Mr. and Mrs. Vincent Lydia and David are from the UK and their phones do not work

5
00:00:20,190 --> 00:00:21,640
in the United States.

6
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:26,490
And I'm thinking about this because because of me I'm not me Luke.

7
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:31,400
Sorry Luke is thinking about this because he's a very thoughtful person.

8
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:41,660
So he asks them or needs to talk about whether or not they need to get SIM cards in the airport one

9
00:00:41,660 --> 00:00:43,790
good place to get a SIM card is the airport.

10
00:00:43,790 --> 00:00:51,710
You don't have to if you need to get a SIM card you might go to maybe a shop in the downtown area that

11
00:00:51,710 --> 00:00:52,570
might be OK too.

12
00:00:52,580 --> 00:00:57,950
Maybe it's cheaper there but let's just look at how we can describe that if we need to.

13
00:00:57,950 --> 00:01:01,910
How can we ask Mr. and Mrs. Vincent about this.

14
00:01:01,910 --> 00:01:03,420
So here are the questions.

15
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:05,840
Do you have phone coverage here.

16
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:11,900
Coverage is what we use when we talk about whether or not we're able to get a signal and it doesn't

17
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:14,020
have to be going to another country.

18
00:01:14,030 --> 00:01:20,660
It could mean for example that there's no signal where we are now even if we're in our own our own country.

19
00:01:20,660 --> 00:01:26,150
Maybe because we are out of range or underground we're in the desert whatever.

20
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:28,770
There's no coverage here there's no coverage.

21
00:01:28,790 --> 00:01:32,060
Maybe in the desert I can't get a signal underground.

22
00:01:32,090 --> 00:01:34,130
So anyway we can say it in this case.

23
00:01:34,130 --> 00:01:35,640
Do you have phone coverage here.

24
00:01:35,660 --> 00:01:42,540
Here means maybe if they're from another country this means in the U.S. A because they're in New York.

25
00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:44,650
Or do you need a local SIM card.

26
00:01:44,660 --> 00:01:54,680
While we're still at the airport this suggests still at the airport that this is a good place to get

27
00:01:54,860 --> 00:01:55,460
it.

28
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:56,730
It's a good place to get it.

29
00:01:56,750 --> 00:01:59,120
We're still here means we're going to leave soon.

30
00:01:59,510 --> 00:02:00,640
We're still here.

31
00:02:00,650 --> 00:02:02,240
That means we're about to go.

32
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:05,440
Does your SIM card work in the States.

33
00:02:05,450 --> 00:02:09,310
Sometimes we call America just the states the USA.

34
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:12,240
We just say the states the United States of America.

35
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:15,050
Does your SIM card work in the States.

36
00:02:15,050 --> 00:02:17,510
Does it function.

37
00:02:17,510 --> 00:02:19,420
Does it function in the States.

38
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:23,670
OK so this is a common question that we will ask in this sort of situation.

39
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:30,260
Or if you have maybe a friend who is a guest in your country and maybe they're staying at your home

40
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:34,670
whatever similar situations you might need to help them and you'll ask this question.

41
00:02:34,670 --> 00:02:39,950
These three are quite common and you can ask variations of these as well.

42
00:02:39,950 --> 00:02:44,000
Now this might come after we've started walking to the car.

43
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:49,910
So just want to mention by the way if it's time to do that right we've done the introductions.

44
00:02:49,910 --> 00:02:52,460
We've talked about how the flight was.

45
00:02:52,460 --> 00:02:53,500
We've said the plan.

46
00:02:53,750 --> 00:03:03,760
Well then we're going to say all right all right well well I've I've got the car parked outside.

47
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:04,890
Shall we.

48
00:03:04,970 --> 00:03:05,900
Shall we.

49
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:07,440
That means shall we go now.

50
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:10,340
It's a very common question when you want to recommend what we do.

51
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:12,230
Well I've got the car parked outside.

52
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:13,090
Shall we.

53
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:14,570
Or are.

54
00:03:14,570 --> 00:03:22,640
Are you ready to head head out now head out just means go.

55
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:27,080
So we could just say that or we could add to the the car.

56
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:28,640
You ready to head out to the car.

57
00:03:28,790 --> 00:03:32,990
Or or when we could say shall we.

58
00:03:32,990 --> 00:03:34,640
Shall we go.

59
00:03:34,670 --> 00:03:35,650
I'll take that.

60
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,910
I'll take that Lydia.

61
00:03:38,810 --> 00:03:39,560
Take what.

62
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:40,190
Her bag.

63
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:41,480
She's carrying a bag.

64
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:42,500
It's very polite.

65
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:48,310
If you pick someone up at the airport to take especially if it's a lady to take a lady's back.

66
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:48,950
Very polite.

67
00:03:48,950 --> 00:03:49,920
I'll take that video.

68
00:03:49,970 --> 00:03:52,790
Or can I take that for you if you want to ask it.

69
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:54,630
Can I take that for you Lydia.

70
00:03:54,650 --> 00:03:58,340
She might say oh no that's OK I've got it I've got it.

71
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:01,010
Ah it's no trouble It's no trouble.

72
00:04:01,010 --> 00:04:01,760
That's OK.

73
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:02,840
Thanks anyway.

74
00:04:02,870 --> 00:04:07,900
If you want to refuse someone politely thanks anyway thanks anyway.

75
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:08,760
I'm OK.

76
00:04:08,810 --> 00:04:09,320
I'm OK.

77
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:11,600
Finally we could say please follow me.

78
00:04:11,630 --> 00:04:12,940
We can go out to the car.

79
00:04:12,950 --> 00:04:15,290
Please follow me please follow me.

80
00:04:15,290 --> 00:04:18,010
Or sometimes after me please.

81
00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:19,740
After me please.

82
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:21,960
Or if you want to be very informal.

83
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:25,180
Well let's go let's go.

84
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:28,940
Although that is pretty informal usually we use let's go with friends.

85
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:29,360
Ready.

86
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:29,530
Yeah.

87
00:04:29,570 --> 00:04:30,860
Let's go let's go.

88
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:37,940
So anyway we are walking along in the airport and I've asked the question do you need a local SIM card

89
00:04:37,970 --> 00:04:42,170
while we're still at the airport and one of them answers.

90
00:04:42,170 --> 00:04:43,320
Maybe it's Lydia.

91
00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:49,310
Actually I think we will need to get at least one and then she might turn to her husband and say Right

92
00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:50,120
David.

93
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:54,740
Or maybe he says actually I think we will need one or maybe two.

94
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:56,010
Do you need one.

95
00:04:56,030 --> 00:04:58,190
Maybe they need to talk with each other as well.

96
00:04:58,230 --> 00:04:58,510
OK.

97
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:00,940
But I think we will need at least one means.

98
00:05:01,010 --> 00:05:01,440
Yes.

99
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:04,210
Let's stop and buy one here at the airport.

100
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:07,300
We're okay actually means they don't need one.

101
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:07,810
We're okay.

102
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:10,070
Actually our plan works abroad.

103
00:05:10,070 --> 00:05:11,750
What does plan mean.

104
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:18,230
Well your plan refers to what you have in your home country either for internet or your phone.

105
00:05:18,230 --> 00:05:24,770
It's often called a calling plan or sometimes it's called a data plan or sometimes it's called a service

106
00:05:25,010 --> 00:05:25,770
plan.

107
00:05:25,850 --> 00:05:31,870
The company that provides your service is sometimes called a service provider.

108
00:05:31,950 --> 00:05:34,490
Sometimes in America for example T-Mobile.

109
00:05:34,490 --> 00:05:35,450
AT&amp;T.

110
00:05:35,450 --> 00:05:41,270
These companies are also called carriers carriers cell phone carriers.

111
00:05:41,350 --> 00:05:44,120
Anyway we're okay actually.

112
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:46,040
This is a way to say no.

113
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:47,160
Would you like some chocolate.

114
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:48,420
I'm OK actually.

115
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:50,080
Would you like a piece of pizza.

116
00:05:50,090 --> 00:05:51,410
I'm okay actually.

117
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:53,660
Do you need me to help you with that bag.

118
00:05:53,660 --> 00:05:57,440
I'm okay actually it's a great way to say no very politely.

119
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:00,490
We can also say I'm good but that's less formal.

120
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:02,480
We can say I'm fine.

121
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:04,170
Actually it means no.

122
00:06:04,190 --> 00:06:06,140
It's very very nice way to say no.

123
00:06:06,290 --> 00:06:07,870
And it's really easy.

124
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:08,420
OK.

125
00:06:08,510 --> 00:06:16,650
Our plan is what we pay for each month to our carrier maybe maybe for our phone abroad works abroad

126
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:16,970
abroad.

127
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:24,390
Just means in other countries not your own country not your local country not just domestically domestically.

128
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:26,280
Just means in your own country.

129
00:06:26,330 --> 00:06:33,980
Domestically we may also need to maybe ask a question about exchanging currency exchanging money exchanging

130
00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:36,800
cash if they haven't done that before.

131
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,130
Before they left.

132
00:06:38,130 --> 00:06:45,350
If they haven't exchanged their money into for example U.S. dollars then they may need to do it on arrival

133
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:52,700
to ask that Luke will say Do you need to exchange any cash or money or currency while we're here again.

134
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:57,940
Same question while we're in the airport it's a good idea to do it before you get out of the airport.

135
00:06:57,980 --> 00:06:59,240
That's a travel tip.

136
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:01,880
Actually yes I'd like to says maybe David.

137
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:03,110
Yes I'd like to.

138
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:06,140
Again if they've already done it David might say no.

139
00:07:06,170 --> 00:07:13,020
We already have some local money or we've already done it or we did it before we left.

140
00:07:13,490 --> 00:07:14,990
Maybe they're very responsible.

141
00:07:14,990 --> 00:07:16,000
Prepare well.

142
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:17,300
Actually yes I'd like to.

143
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:22,650
Would you recommend using an A.T.M. or going to an exchange counter.

144
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:28,730
So sometimes you can get cash using a credit card even if it's not in your country.

145
00:07:28,790 --> 00:07:35,510
Go to the A.T.M. put it in credit card and you get local currency it takes it out of your own maybe

146
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:38,450
credit from from your own currency.

147
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:39,570
Maybe there's a fee.

148
00:07:39,590 --> 00:07:40,720
That's what I usually do.

149
00:07:40,730 --> 00:07:44,480
By the way cause I'm a little bit lazy about that kind of thing.

150
00:07:44,530 --> 00:07:49,160
OK so would you recommend using an A.T.M. or going to an exchange counter.

151
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:51,880
This is the one that you usually find in the airport.

152
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:57,950
Now it's probably better to do exchanging in the airport because you don't usually find exchange counters

153
00:07:58,550 --> 00:08:00,650
around around the city.

154
00:08:00,650 --> 00:08:04,910
Sometimes depending on where you are but the airport is a good location for it.

155
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:07,490
OK now what should we recommend.

156
00:08:07,490 --> 00:08:13,250
Well we could say I would recommend or my suggestion is we could say.

157
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:18,320
My suggestion is or would be to just use the A.T.M. it's very convenient.

158
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:21,010
Just use your credit card or hide.

159
00:08:21,050 --> 00:08:26,900
I would recommend going to an exchange counter because it's just over there.

160
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:28,010
It's just over there.

161
00:08:28,010 --> 00:08:30,440
Or there's one right over there.

162
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:35,970
Sometimes we say right over there if it's nearby right over there.

163
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:38,330
The exchange rate is pretty good.

164
00:08:38,330 --> 00:08:45,530
Exchange rate means the amount of local currency you get from your own currency means money.

165
00:08:45,530 --> 00:08:45,850
Right.

166
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:49,380
The local currency you get and the exchange rate goes up and down.

167
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:54,740
If we say it's a good exchange rate that means you get more money from your money.

168
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:58,920
Basically if it's a bad exchange rate then kind of lose money.

169
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:05,060
And also we could talk about fees the exchange rate is nothing about what you pay to the people at the

170
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:05,870
counter.

171
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:11,380
The exchange rate is just the value of your money compared to the value of the money you're getting.

172
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:14,030
The fee is what you pay extra.

173
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:20,420
So I could say if I want to talk about fees the exchange rate is pretty good right now and maybe the

174
00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:27,500
fees the fees they're over there at that counter are low.

175
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:32,000
The fees are low that means they don't charge very much.

176
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:32,960
Okay thanks.

177
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:34,400
That means he has.

178
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:37,530
David has accepted my recommendation.

179
00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:43,610
So this is something that comes up sometimes not as often maybe as the phone situation but whenever

180
00:09:43,610 --> 00:09:46,210
you need to help somebody who's come to your country.

181
00:09:46,310 --> 00:09:52,010
This is how you would express basically whether or not they need to get local money.
