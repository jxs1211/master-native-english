1
00:00:04,100 --> 00:00:07,250
In the last lesson we talked about cooking and cuisine.

2
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:14,280
How to talk about different types of food and how to describe a recipe how we prepare a particular dish.

3
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:19,660
In this lesson we're going to talk about a situation picking someone up at the airport.

4
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:25,460
Now this is a relatively common situation but we'll find as we go through this lesson.

5
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:32,040
A lot of common things that happen in regular conversations with people we meet usually for the first

6
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:35,520
time that we can also use in lots of other ways.

7
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:37,520
Lots of other situations.

8
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:41,340
I've written a dialogue similar to what I did for the hotel class.

9
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:48,060
So what we're going to do in this lesson is go through it step by step and explore the phrases that

10
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:54,750
we use at different points in the conversation and then we'll also expand that and talk about how we

11
00:00:54,750 --> 00:01:00,430
can use those phrases for example in other similar situations.

12
00:01:00,450 --> 00:01:07,350
So actually we're learning things that can be used in a wide variety of cases not only picking someone

13
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:08,790
up at the airport.

14
00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:09,690
So let's begin.
