1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:07,470
So far in our dialogue about Luke picking up Mr. and Mrs. Vincent at the airport we've made the basic

2
00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:13,350
introductions and gone through the we can say the basics asking how the flight was.

3
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:17,640
Now we need to actually recommend or suggest what to do next.

4
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:21,540
Luke needs to say what the choices are.

5
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:25,540
Now I want to mention one point about American culture in particular.

6
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:34,590
It's usually a good idea to offer options or ask whether what you're suggesting is okay if you say we're

7
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:38,310
going to do this and then we're going to do this and then we're going to do this and then we're going

8
00:00:38,310 --> 00:00:39,500
to do this.

9
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:46,320
Generally speaking Americans will feel like they're trapped and they don't have a choice.

10
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:48,810
And that could be an uncomfortable feeling.

11
00:00:48,860 --> 00:00:50,990
No it's not true in every culture certainly.

12
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,040
But that's generally the idea in America.

13
00:00:53,070 --> 00:01:00,060
So I would recommend if you find yourself in a situation like this with Americans offer some options

14
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:06,600
give a few choices or make one recommendation and then at the end just ask if that's OK.

15
00:01:06,690 --> 00:01:08,110
Which is pretty easy to do.

16
00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:09,840
Let's look at how we can do that.

17
00:01:09,850 --> 00:01:13,430
OK so how about we go to your hotel first.

18
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:14,900
This is Luke speaking.

19
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:16,860
This is Luke speaking.

20
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:22,380
How about we go to your hotel first so that you can unpack OK unpack means take your stuff out of your

21
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:28,920
bag maybe put your your coat on the hanger and maybe take your shoes out of your bag whatever you need

22
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:29,640
to do.

23
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:32,240
Unpack your bags and relax for a while.

24
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:34,170
OK that's a recommendation.

25
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:38,520
Then we can meet the others and have dinner maybe around 8:00.

26
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:42,430
So we do have a question there at the end maybe around 8:00.

27
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:50,730
Now if they wanted to they could say well we're really not feeling up to or in the mood for going out

28
00:01:50,730 --> 00:01:53,440
and having a dinner tonight.

29
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:55,880
So maybe we can just relax at the hotel.

30
00:01:55,890 --> 00:01:56,150
All right.

31
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:56,760
That's fine.

32
00:01:56,790 --> 00:01:57,500
That's fine.

33
00:01:57,550 --> 00:01:57,880
OK.

34
00:01:57,910 --> 00:02:00,140
Or sorry to hear about the flight.

35
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:04,920
Maybe they said it's a terrible was a terrible flight we had turbulence the whole time.

36
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:06,490
Well sorry to hear about the flight.

37
00:02:06,510 --> 00:02:11,710
Now we need to change the topic anyway very good way to do that.

38
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:14,310
Anyway I hope you enjoy your stay in New York.

39
00:02:14,370 --> 00:02:22,290
So I'm trying to shift the discussion shift the conversation to a more optimistic or positive light.

40
00:02:22,450 --> 00:02:22,830
OK.

41
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:28,790
Trying to push it into more optimistic territory an optimistic space.

42
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:30,540
I hope you enjoy your stay in New York.

43
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:37,080
I think we can go to the hotel first so that you can unpack your bags and rest for a bit.

44
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:38,280
Does that sound good.

45
00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:41,010
So this is a straight recommendation.

46
00:02:41,010 --> 00:02:42,710
This is what I'm saying we should do.

47
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:44,410
Then I want to confirm it.

48
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:49,260
So you want to avoid saying we will go to your hotel so that you can rest for a bit.

49
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:55,530
How about makes it sound softer and then does that sound good.

50
00:02:55,530 --> 00:03:01,430
Allows them to confirm that that's OK and if it's not then they can say so now.

51
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:06,840
Sometimes we want to give several choices maybe maybe they want to go to the hotel maybe they want to

52
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:15,660
eat right away then I can ask Would you rather this is a great way to offer options.

53
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:22,650
Would you rather go out and have lunch and then go to the hotel or go directly to the hotel so that

54
00:03:22,650 --> 00:03:26,660
you can rest then they can say what they want to do.

55
00:03:26,670 --> 00:03:27,160
OK.

56
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:31,340
Now generally in this situation if I say What do you want to do next.

57
00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:36,680
It's a little weird because while we're at the airport so we're not going to just stay here.

58
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:41,070
I guess you could say something like Well where would you like to go.

59
00:03:41,130 --> 00:03:44,400
But in this situation it's better to offer choices.

60
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:48,740
Would you rather go to the hotel now or have lunch first.

61
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:50,490
OK give some options.

62
00:03:50,490 --> 00:03:50,910
All right.

63
00:03:50,910 --> 00:03:52,830
This is how we do that.

64
00:03:52,830 --> 00:03:57,810
Finally Lydia or David says yep sounds perfect.

65
00:03:57,810 --> 00:03:58,990
What sounds perfect.

66
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:03,230
This plan this thing I'm suggesting sounds perfect.

67
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:04,350
I like the plan.

68
00:04:04,350 --> 00:04:07,290
Anytime you like a plan you can say sounds perfect.

69
00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:12,570
We learned that with the with the lesson about inviting friends.

70
00:04:12,570 --> 00:04:15,610
We want to change and take a shower as well.

71
00:04:15,710 --> 00:04:18,630
OK as well change means to change your clothes.

72
00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:21,740
Then dinner sounds great.

73
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:23,690
Dinner sounds great.

74
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:25,440
When you make dinner sounds great.

75
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:28,530
Well what it really means is going to dinner sounds great.

76
00:04:28,530 --> 00:04:30,440
Want to grab a coffee.

77
00:04:30,510 --> 00:04:32,730
Coffee sounds great.

78
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:33,910
Coffee sounds great.

79
00:04:33,910 --> 00:04:39,440
Well again yes it is a noun but what you're really saying is it sounds great to me.

80
00:04:39,450 --> 00:04:44,550
The idea of going to get a cup of coffee but it's just a simple way to say that.
