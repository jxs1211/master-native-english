1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:05,430
Now we've been through basically the whole dialogue how we can deal with picking somebody up at the

2
00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:09,490
airport the things we need to say and how to be polite.

3
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:12,890
Now the hardest part could be the car ride home.

4
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:19,140
So before we finish this lesson I'd just like to talk about how we can make conversation on the way

5
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:21,690
home if we have a 30 minute car ride.

6
00:00:21,690 --> 00:00:25,790
We need to have something to talk about and it's a great opportunity for us.

7
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:31,440
Me Lydia and David to get to know each other better because before all I've had our emails back and

8
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:37,980
forth with David OK now in the airport we were just talking about essential stuff stuff we need to talk

9
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:43,290
about like how their flight was whether or not they need a SIM card or they need to exchange currency

10
00:00:43,470 --> 00:00:44,940
or they want to go to their hotel.

11
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:46,180
That's the basic stuff.

12
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:49,280
Now we can actually have a conversation.

13
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:54,960
I don't want to talk too much about this because we really did focus on the important aspects of it

14
00:00:54,990 --> 00:00:58,200
when we were doing our lesson about asking good questions.

15
00:00:58,200 --> 00:00:58,850
Right.

16
00:00:58,860 --> 00:01:04,080
However let's just go through a few things we can say and I want to mention one or two questions which

17
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:08,430
are kind of standard but in my opinion not that interesting.

18
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:11,910
So anyway they might ask me questions now I'm sorry Luke.

19
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:13,220
Questions not me.

20
00:01:13,230 --> 00:01:16,620
They might ask Luke questions on the car ride home I'm driving.

21
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:20,130
Maybe it's 30 minutes or 40 minutes to downtown.

22
00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:21,480
I don't know why I'm driving like this.

23
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:26,160
I guess the car is going like this to Mr. insane driver.

24
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:28,980
I don't even have my driver's license.

25
00:01:29,090 --> 00:01:34,920
OK so they might ask me questions and I can of course talk about New York and I can talk about my job

26
00:01:35,010 --> 00:01:37,740
but I can ask them some questions too.

27
00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:42,090
So Lydia what plans do you have while you're here in New York.

28
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:46,340
She's not here on business so it's a good opportunity to know what she wants to do.

29
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:50,580
Then we might be able to continue a conversation if she says Oh I'd really like to.

30
00:01:50,590 --> 00:01:56,100
Blah blah blah blah blah or I don't know then I can recommend something and we can get a conversation

31
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:59,190
going or I could ask David a similar question.

32
00:01:59,190 --> 00:02:07,240
I could say David after we finish every day do you have any plans or I could say David besides work.

33
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:10,070
What would you like to do while you're here in New York.

34
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:11,940
And we can have a conversation about that.

35
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:16,410
That's a whole conversation that could take the whole 30 minute car ride.

36
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:18,620
So Lydia what do you do.

37
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:20,520
There's a very common question.

38
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:25,170
I know David's job because he's here for business but I don't know what Lydia does.

39
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:29,500
So maybe I can ask this and this means what is your job.

40
00:02:29,610 --> 00:02:33,200
Lydia maybe she says oh I'm just a housewife.

41
00:02:33,210 --> 00:02:33,440
OK.

42
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:38,700
So then we can talk about that or maybe she has a job then we can talk about that.

43
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:41,160
This is just the beginning of a conversation.

44
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:42,120
So is this one.

45
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:44,250
I like this one very much.

46
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:46,280
This is what I will usually ask.

47
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:47,060
OK.

48
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:50,760
You mentioned in your email David that you have two children.

49
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:56,420
So are they in school or Now notice I don't really finish the question here.

50
00:02:56,460 --> 00:03:02,340
This is an interesting way to ask a question that we know other people would like to talk about.

51
00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:05,580
You know what people love talking about their children.

52
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:11,700
So if you know they have children they will probably go on and on and tell you about their children

53
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:13,500
for 40 minutes and that's fine.

54
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:14,370
That's great.

55
00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:17,830
So by just saying so are they in school or.

56
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:23,550
It's like saying I'm giving you permission to start talking about them but you would only use this if

57
00:03:23,550 --> 00:03:31,050
you know that the other person probably has a lot to say if you're not sure then don't use this style

58
00:03:31,050 --> 00:03:34,470
of sentence can be risky because if you say or.

59
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:39,440
And then they have nothing to say then it can be very awkward OK.

60
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:43,630
So you can use it but only if you know they have a lot to say.

61
00:03:43,710 --> 00:03:49,130
I'd love to hear more about your life and your family in London maybe there from from London.

62
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:56,230
OK this is a similar question but I'm not suggesting that I know anything about their background it

63
00:03:56,320 --> 00:04:00,600
is more of a statement but it's really a request for information.

64
00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:04,060
This question in my opinion is a little bit boring.

65
00:04:04,230 --> 00:04:09,490
I'm not crazy about this one because it's not really focused your life.

66
00:04:09,510 --> 00:04:10,880
Talk about your life.

67
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:12,570
They could really talk about anything.

68
00:04:12,570 --> 00:04:17,850
So on one hand it might be good if there's something they would like to talk about on the other hand

69
00:04:18,030 --> 00:04:21,680
it might not be so good if they don't really know where to begin.

70
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:24,050
So I could start with this.

71
00:04:24,050 --> 00:04:26,570
Have you ever tried real New York pizza.

72
00:04:26,570 --> 00:04:32,700
OK then if they say no then I can recommend some places or if they say yes I can ask them what kind

73
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:33,720
of pizza they've had.

74
00:04:33,810 --> 00:04:35,320
And we can talk about that.

75
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:37,680
I love talking about New York pizza.

76
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:40,210
I can talk about that for three hours.

77
00:04:40,230 --> 00:04:44,280
So what do you think about New York so far.

78
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:50,460
Now this question you have to be careful about because if we're just driving home sorry to the hotel

79
00:04:50,850 --> 00:04:58,480
and they have barely been in New York really then they don't really have any impression of New York.

80
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:04,280
So you have to be careful with my want to use this one after maybe they've been here for a day or two.

81
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:08,160
Then I meet them for dinner after they've been in New York for a couple of days.

82
00:05:08,170 --> 00:05:11,070
And I say So what do you think of New York so far.

83
00:05:11,170 --> 00:05:12,710
That might be a better question.

84
00:05:12,730 --> 00:05:13,950
In that situation.

85
00:05:13,990 --> 00:05:15,790
OK so David.

86
00:05:15,790 --> 00:05:19,060
So David do you follow any sports now.

87
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:26,910
This question I find to be very boring personally but honestly a lot of people do ask it.

88
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:31,190
So I'm including it because it's a common discussion question.

89
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:35,620
It's a common question that comes up in regular conversations.

90
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:40,510
When you've met somebody new and you're trying to get to know them you talk about sports maybe talk

91
00:05:40,510 --> 00:05:45,070
about movies it's OK but personally I think it's a little boring.

92
00:05:45,070 --> 00:05:46,280
Now you might have heard.

93
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:47,320
What about the weather.

94
00:05:47,350 --> 00:05:47,810
Right.

95
00:05:47,830 --> 00:05:51,900
So we might ask So how's the weather in London this time of year.

96
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:54,380
How's the weather in England this time of year.

97
00:05:54,430 --> 00:05:55,580
You can say it.

98
00:05:55,630 --> 00:05:56,430
People say it.

99
00:05:56,530 --> 00:06:01,450
Personally I never asked this question because it's so boring.

100
00:06:01,450 --> 00:06:03,280
But anyway people do say it.

101
00:06:03,370 --> 00:06:10,240
So that is how we deal with picking somebody up at the airport going through small talk with them and

102
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:16,750
handling the essentials the important things we need to handle and having discussions or at least a

103
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:23,320
polite conversation with them on the way back to the hotel on the way downtown.

104
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:29,530
Now that we've been through all of the phrases and things you can say in the picking up someone at the

105
00:06:29,530 --> 00:06:32,710
airport dialogue I'd like you to practice it.

106
00:06:32,710 --> 00:06:38,260
I'd like you to record yourself doing all of the different roles in the dialogue.

107
00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:40,540
Think about it in this lesson.

108
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:43,690
I've done all the roles I've recorded it.

109
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:47,010
You're watching it right so you can do it by yourself.

110
00:06:47,010 --> 00:06:47,420
I'm.

111
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:48,970
I'm doing it by myself.

112
00:06:48,970 --> 00:06:51,940
I'm here in this room right.

113
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:58,780
Doing this by myself so you can play all of the roles and imagine that you're picking someone up at

114
00:06:58,780 --> 00:07:02,240
the airport who you've never met before.

115
00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:03,500
I try to make it interesting.

116
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:04,660
Tried a couple of times.

117
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:08,220
Go back listen to the recording see if you can make corrections.

118
00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:10,740
Find mistakes and then try it again.

119
00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:11,380
Try it again.

120
00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:13,050
It's a great way to practice.

121
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:13,330
All right.

122
00:07:13,330 --> 00:07:15,990
Good luck and I will see you in the next lesson.
