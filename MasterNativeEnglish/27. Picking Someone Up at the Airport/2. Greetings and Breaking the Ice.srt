1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:03,480
Before we get started with the dialogue let's just set the scene.

2
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:09,900
That means describe basically what's happening and talk about the roles or the characters involved with

3
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:11,340
this little story.

4
00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:16,800
So one person let's call him Mr. Vincent

5
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:29,390
and his first name will be David is taking a business trip to New York to visit the company where another

6
00:00:29,390 --> 00:00:31,310
person works the other person's name.

7
00:00:31,340 --> 00:00:37,940
The person who lives in New York and works at that company is Luke same person.

8
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:41,050
Maybe could be me maybe not.

9
00:00:41,420 --> 00:00:48,500
And David Vincent or Mr. Vincent has a wife and she's coming along now she is not on a business trip

10
00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:50,930
but she wants to come to New York.

11
00:00:50,990 --> 00:00:52,580
She's coming with him.

12
00:00:52,580 --> 00:00:58,050
She can maybe hang out go shopping or do whatever she wants.

13
00:00:58,330 --> 00:01:02,160
And her name is Lydia why.

14
00:01:02,310 --> 00:01:09,240
OK so Mr. Vincent or David Vincent is visiting the company where Luke works on business for whatever

15
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:10,050
reason.

16
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:12,590
And Lydia is his wife.

17
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:13,770
She's coming along.

18
00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:15,870
She's going to accompany him.

19
00:01:15,890 --> 00:01:16,470
OK.

20
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:18,600
And Luke lives in New York.

21
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:24,260
So Luke is going to actually pick up Mr. Vincent or David Vincent and his wife at the airport.

22
00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:26,260
They have never met before.

23
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:26,920
Never.

24
00:01:26,930 --> 00:01:27,150
OK.

25
00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:29,300
So maybe they've communicated by email.

26
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:35,790
They've discussed things before they've talked about details but this is their first in-person in-person

27
00:01:36,510 --> 00:01:37,140
meeting.

28
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:37,600
All right.

29
00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:39,050
So that's the scene.

30
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:40,180
That's what's going on.

31
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:45,060
And these are the characters that we will encounter in our dialogue.

32
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:46,200
Let us begin.

33
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:54,570
David Vincent and his wife have landed and they've gone through to the baggage claim area to get their

34
00:01:54,570 --> 00:01:55,350
bags.

35
00:01:55,500 --> 00:02:01,650
And now they're going through the arrivals gate called the arrivals gate where people come out and often

36
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:07,920
there are many people in front of the arrivals gate waiting for family members or whatever if sometimes

37
00:02:08,010 --> 00:02:13,380
if you're waiting for someone and you've never met them you might have a sign that says David and Lydia

38
00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:15,360
Vincent maybe maybe not.

39
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:18,180
If you've seen a picture of each other maybe it's not necessary.

40
00:02:18,210 --> 00:02:27,210
But anyway here's Luke with his very poorly drawn head and crazy hair and sleepy eyes waiting for waiting

41
00:02:27,210 --> 00:02:29,310
for the Vincent's.

42
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:34,510
And he sees who he thinks are Mr. and Mrs. Vincent.

43
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:35,480
David and Lydia.

44
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:40,890
Vincent coming out of the arrivals gate and they're pulling their hair pulling their bags along they're

45
00:02:40,890 --> 00:02:42,370
pulling their luggage along.

46
00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:45,350
Their luggage has wheels OK.

47
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:48,180
And there's a certain look right.

48
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:49,380
Maybe they see the sign.

49
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:53,070
If there's no sign maybe they just guessed that it's the other person.

50
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:55,080
But still you need to confirm.

51
00:02:55,170 --> 00:03:00,690
So let's let's go through what we need to say when we need to confirm who this person is even though

52
00:03:00,690 --> 00:03:01,830
we're pretty sure.

53
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:02,390
OK.

54
00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:03,120
Excuse me.

55
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:05,630
Luke might say so this is what Luke says.

56
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:07,990
Excuse me are you Mr. Vincent.

57
00:03:08,010 --> 00:03:13,640
So Mr. Vincent sees Luke with the sign holding the sign and he walks up to the sign.

58
00:03:13,770 --> 00:03:16,530
So clearly it is but you still have to confirm.

59
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:20,460
Excuse me are you Mr. Vincent or just a question Mr. Vincent.

60
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:21,250
Mr. Vincent.

61
00:03:21,270 --> 00:03:28,530
But it's very important to ask with a question tone if you say a question and you don't want to use

62
00:03:28,650 --> 00:03:29,990
are you.

63
00:03:29,990 --> 00:03:35,880
It's very very important to make sure that you add a question tone so that your voice goes near and

64
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:40,850
in it Mr. Vincent hungry ready sleepy.

65
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:41,490
Ok.

66
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:43,640
Very important to have that question tone.

67
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:50,440
Ok then Mr. Vincent or David says yes please call me David please call me David.

68
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:51,500
You must be Luke.

69
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:52,950
Now this could be switched.

70
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:58,290
Luke could say you must be David because David has walked up to the sign so that's OK to both of these

71
00:03:58,290 --> 00:03:58,930
work.

72
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:01,650
You must be or with a question Tom.

73
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,650
Mr. Vincent look like that.

74
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:04,960
It could go either way.

75
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:05,220
All right.

76
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:06,300
Yes that's right.

77
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:07,500
Nice to meet you.

78
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:08,370
Yes that's right.

79
00:04:08,370 --> 00:04:10,450
Nice to meet you.

80
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:10,990
OK.

81
00:04:11,070 --> 00:04:19,500
We can then add here if we want to we can say nice to finally meet you or nice to meet you and then

82
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:26,640
we could add here in person or we could say nice to finally meet you in person.

83
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:31,190
That means we've kind of met before but maybe we just met by email.

84
00:04:31,230 --> 00:04:32,220
So we didn't really meet.

85
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:35,640
So we say in person that means face to face.

86
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:37,670
So all of these can work.

87
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:41,920
They can be flipped around but these are the phrases that are typically used here.

88
00:04:41,970 --> 00:04:47,910
But Mrs. Vincent is also here so it's very important that she become part of the conversation right

89
00:04:47,910 --> 00:04:52,140
at the beginning because if she doesn't then she feels left out.

90
00:04:52,170 --> 00:04:56,120
She feels uncomfortable and the situation will be very awkward.

91
00:04:56,170 --> 00:05:02,190
So we want to avoid an awkward situation something that's awkward is where people who are there talking

92
00:05:02,190 --> 00:05:04,230
to each other don't feel comfortable.

93
00:05:04,230 --> 00:05:12,840
So if Luke doesn't recognize Mrs. Vincent or Lydia or maybe if David doesn't introduce his wife things

94
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:20,100
will get awkward very soon even though Luke and David are the ones who know each other who have corresponded

95
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:22,240
maybe over the last few weeks.

96
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:25,310
So let's look at the phrases we use for that.

97
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:27,850
So let's get Lydia involved in the conversation.

98
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:35,860
Luke might say you must be Mrs. Vincent so you can do the same thing as before but with the person who

99
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:38,070
who is with Mr. Vincent.

100
00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:40,850
Then she has to confirm.

101
00:05:41,050 --> 00:05:47,190
I'm not going to write L because that would be confusing to have two l's but I am going to write M V.

102
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:50,020
Mrs. Vincent Yes that's right.

103
00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:51,310
Good to meet you.

104
00:05:51,310 --> 00:05:52,000
Good to meet you.

105
00:05:51,990 --> 00:05:52,320
Good day.

106
00:05:52,330 --> 00:05:53,230
Nice to meet you.

107
00:05:53,230 --> 00:05:54,490
Pleasure to meet you.

108
00:05:54,490 --> 00:05:55,660
Pleasure to meet you.

109
00:05:55,660 --> 00:05:58,930
Aw it's a pleasure to meet you is more formal.

110
00:05:58,930 --> 00:06:00,630
So be careful with that.

111
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:04,900
You can say it here but you could also say Good to meet you and then you can use the name.

112
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:06,090
Good to meet you Luke.

113
00:06:06,110 --> 00:06:06,740
Ok.

114
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:10,900
Or Mrs. Vincent could say this is an alternative one.

115
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:11,560
Yes I am.

116
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:13,510
You must be Mrs. Vincent.

117
00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:14,610
Yes I am.

118
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:16,520
Yes I am Mrs. Vincent.

119
00:06:16,540 --> 00:06:18,690
You can call me Lydia.

120
00:06:18,730 --> 00:06:19,980
You can call me Lydia.

121
00:06:19,990 --> 00:06:28,480
This is a good way to give people a more relaxed and informal feeling in basic conversation especially

122
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:32,650
when you've just met somebody by by saying you can call me Blah blah blah.

123
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:34,870
It makes it feel a little informal.

124
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:37,420
And that's good because then you can get to know them.

125
00:06:37,510 --> 00:06:42,850
And if you're always saying Mr. Vincent this is Vincent then it feels a little bit a little bit stiff

126
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:46,340
and not unfriendly but maybe too formal.

127
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:48,040
Yes I am.

128
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,210
You can call me Lydia.

129
00:06:49,210 --> 00:06:50,830
It's nice meeting you.

130
00:06:50,830 --> 00:06:52,150
It's nice meeting you.

131
00:06:52,150 --> 00:06:54,750
Now we'll look at what Lou can say down here.

132
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:57,550
But Lou could say of course likewise.

133
00:06:57,550 --> 00:07:03,190
It's nice to meet you too or you too sometimes Lou can say that as well.

134
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:06,550
Now this is what David Vincent.

135
00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:13,390
Mr. Vincent says by the way whenever you want to suddenly change topics whatever it is you ought to

136
00:07:13,390 --> 00:07:16,360
mention something else that's unrelated.

137
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:17,400
Then we can use.

138
00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:18,610
By the way.

139
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:24,160
Now another way to do this is to say instead of by the way oh as though you forgot something.

140
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:25,710
Oh yes.

141
00:07:26,260 --> 00:07:31,320
Which might make Mrs. Vincent feel a little uncomfortable like he forgot his wife.

142
00:07:31,330 --> 00:07:31,630
Right.

143
00:07:31,930 --> 00:07:33,640
So it's probably better here to use.

144
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:37,050
By the way by the way this is my wife Lydia.

145
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:40,340
And then Luke would say hi there.

146
00:07:40,390 --> 00:07:43,090
I've heard a lot about you from David.

147
00:07:43,090 --> 00:07:44,950
I've heard a lot about you from David.

148
00:07:44,950 --> 00:07:51,160
This is a common expression to use when you first met someone and you know the person who's introducing

149
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:56,020
them whether it's a brother or a sister or a friend or a spouse.

150
00:07:56,020 --> 00:07:58,100
In this case husband or wife.

151
00:07:58,540 --> 00:08:03,700
I've heard a lot about you means maybe David has told me about his wife.

152
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:11,340
In our e-mail exchanges makes the exchanges over the past few weeks.

153
00:08:11,470 --> 00:08:13,180
So this is also very common.

154
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:15,920
It's great to meet you both.

155
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:17,800
It's great to meet you both.

156
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:23,990
This one could be used if Luke hasn't already said Nice to meet you too David.

157
00:08:24,010 --> 00:08:26,740
So David has said maybe you must be Luke.

158
00:08:26,770 --> 00:08:27,500
Yes that's right.

159
00:08:27,550 --> 00:08:32,850
Oh this is my wife Lydia and oh it's it's nice to meet you both.

160
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:34,500
Luke could say so.

161
00:08:34,510 --> 00:08:38,180
You can cover two people with one it's nice to meet you there.

162
00:08:38,290 --> 00:08:41,710
If if it hasn't already been said so that's possible.

163
00:08:41,710 --> 00:08:45,330
And then whenever you want to return what somebody says to you.

164
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:47,370
You feel the same way you can say.

165
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:50,250
Likewise likewise as I mentioned up here.

166
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:52,090
So if I say tonight.

167
00:08:52,150 --> 00:08:53,280
Nice to meet you both.

168
00:08:53,290 --> 00:08:55,080
They both say likewise.

169
00:08:55,090 --> 00:08:57,400
Or maybe they say it's nice to meet you.

170
00:08:57,400 --> 00:09:01,940
Maybe Lydia says it's very nice to meet you and I say Likewise likewise.

171
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:05,280
That means it's nice to meet you too.

172
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:09,910
You can use likewise in a lot of other places you could say for example.

173
00:09:09,910 --> 00:09:11,590
I really like your shoes.

174
00:09:11,650 --> 00:09:12,970
Likewise.

175
00:09:12,970 --> 00:09:15,160
That means I like your shoes too.

176
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:18,260
So that's a way to say you too.

177
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:20,140
Sort of like playing ping pong.

178
00:09:20,180 --> 00:09:20,570
Hey.

179
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,000
Yeah you too.

180
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,890
Now this one is a little bit less formal.

181
00:09:23,890 --> 00:09:29,260
This one might be too informal for this situation so kind of have to be careful with that but you can

182
00:09:29,260 --> 00:09:31,550
say you to you too.

183
00:09:31,570 --> 00:09:34,030
You could say it's nice to meet you too.

184
00:09:34,090 --> 00:09:36,130
All of these are OK all right.

185
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:42,340
So now all people all three of us are in the conversation in the dialogue.

186
00:09:42,370 --> 00:09:50,230
Now we can continue and go to the question that we must ask if we've just picked someone up at the airport

187
00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:54,710
and if you don't ask this question it's pretty much rude.

188
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:58,370
So you have to ask this question which question you ask.

189
00:09:58,390 --> 00:09:59,690
Let's look at it now.

190
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:04,980
If you pick somebody up at the airport you have to ask them how the flight was.

191
00:10:04,990 --> 00:10:06,810
You could say How was your flight.

192
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:10,340
Or you could say How was the flight.

193
00:10:10,390 --> 00:10:14,220
Both of those are OK but you really have to ask this question.

194
00:10:14,350 --> 00:10:16,750
They're going to expect you to ask it.

195
00:10:16,780 --> 00:10:24,110
It's really just a formality formality is something in usually a social situation not only.

196
00:10:24,110 --> 00:10:28,120
But something that kind of has to be done that's expected expected basically.

197
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:28,360
OK.

198
00:10:28,390 --> 00:10:31,180
So how is your flight.

199
00:10:31,390 --> 00:10:37,450
This structure really is an important part of speaking English naturally and communicating with other

200
00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:40,310
native English speakers and in fact not.

201
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:46,830
Not every culture uses questions to get people to tell you what they think about something sometimes

202
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:47,890
different.

203
00:10:47,890 --> 00:10:50,470
Different cultures you just say your opinion right.

204
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:57,370
But in America particularly in American English you have to ask questions like How was your day.

205
00:10:57,550 --> 00:10:59,170
How was the flight.

206
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:00,520
How was work.

207
00:11:00,730 --> 00:11:02,250
How's your family doing.

208
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:05,020
Whatever it is how's your job going.

209
00:11:05,110 --> 00:11:10,030
This way we're able to get other people to share and then start a conversation.

210
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:11,230
That's very very important.

211
00:11:11,230 --> 00:11:14,120
So in this situation you really have to ask this.

212
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:16,390
How was your flight.

213
00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:17,190
If you don't ask.

214
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:20,320
Maybe they want to talk about the flight but they don't have a chance.

215
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:24,280
They feel like they have no opportunity to share their opinion.

216
00:11:24,310 --> 00:11:30,880
Often native English speakers particularly in America need a question as a way to begin talking about

217
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:36,150
something and even if they want to say something they won't unless they get a question.

218
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:38,400
First part of the culture.

219
00:11:38,510 --> 00:11:43,330
OK it was fine but the in-flight meal could say the food.

220
00:11:43,330 --> 00:11:48,180
We could also say the food the food was really not good.

221
00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:50,720
Really not good or not great.

222
00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:52,930
Or we could say terrible.

223
00:11:52,930 --> 00:11:55,280
Or we could say fantastic if it was good.

224
00:11:55,390 --> 00:11:56,290
But then we wouldn't say.

225
00:11:56,290 --> 00:11:57,490
But it was fine.

226
00:11:57,490 --> 00:11:59,610
But the in-flight me it was really not good.

227
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:00,740
The flight attendants.

228
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:02,970
Those are the people who work on the plane.

229
00:12:03,010 --> 00:12:06,280
Basically waiters and waitresses called flight attendants.

230
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:09,420
That's male and female by the way male flight attendants.

231
00:12:09,550 --> 00:12:13,250
Female flight attendants were all really friendly though.

232
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:13,560
OK.

233
00:12:13,590 --> 00:12:17,440
So this is a way to say but they were all very friendly.

234
00:12:17,460 --> 00:12:19,660
OK the flight attendants were all very friendly.

235
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:21,530
That made it more comfortable.

236
00:12:21,550 --> 00:12:23,070
What made it more comfortable.

237
00:12:23,170 --> 00:12:24,770
The friendly flight attendants.

238
00:12:24,790 --> 00:12:29,220
OK so we have we have a bad thing the food we have a good thing the flight attendants.

239
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:29,700
OK.

240
00:12:29,730 --> 00:12:37,900
Anyway anyway this is another way to make a final comment or sometimes go on to your last your last

241
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:38,620
point.

242
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:43,460
If you're describing something or finish at least finish what you're saying.

243
00:12:43,570 --> 00:12:46,360
Anyway we're glad to finally be here.

244
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:52,180
So that suggests finally suggests it was a rather long rather long flight.

245
00:12:52,290 --> 00:12:52,880
OK.

246
00:12:52,990 --> 00:12:54,330
How was your flight.

247
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:55,270
It was pretty good.

248
00:12:55,270 --> 00:12:56,080
Pretty good.

249
00:12:56,110 --> 00:13:00,480
Sometimes instead of using pretty good we say something like Well I can't complain.

250
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,350
OK not bad.

251
00:13:02,530 --> 00:13:05,470
So so really horrible really horrible.

252
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:06,050
Oh really well.

253
00:13:06,090 --> 00:13:07,360
Why was it so horrible.

254
00:13:07,390 --> 00:13:08,860
Oh the whole flight.

255
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:11,110
We had terrible turbulence.

256
00:13:11,110 --> 00:13:13,480
This is when the plane shakes in the air.

257
00:13:13,930 --> 00:13:14,800
That's a horrible flight.

258
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:18,050
If that's happening the whole time terrible turbulence.

259
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:18,360
OK.

260
00:13:18,370 --> 00:13:19,740
Or we could say it was pretty good.

261
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:28,900
But we're we are we're quite tired after our long trip and looking forward to a bit of rest.

262
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:34,840
Now what that tells me if I'm picking them up is they want to go back to their hotel and maybe take

263
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:39,800
a nap or just hang out for a little while and do nothing because they feel tired.

264
00:13:40,190 --> 00:13:47,080
Ok so I might want to say that next because I've recognized that's what they want because they're looking

265
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:49,220
forward to a bit of rest.

266
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:56,050
Now if this is an international flight and they've come from another country at least six or seven hours

267
00:13:56,050 --> 00:14:04,510
away then maybe we can talk about something called jet lag and jet lag is the idea of because you live

268
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:12,010
in another place far away you in your mind believe you feel that it is a different time.

269
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:19,300
So where you arrived it's 7:00 p.m. but maybe you feel it's only noon depending on where where you are

270
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:27,580
or maybe you feel instead of it being 7 p.m. maybe you feel at 7 a.m. This is called jet lag.

271
00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:36,050
I am so jet lagged I am so jet lagged.

272
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:38,480
I really need to just sleep.

273
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:44,500
So jet lag is how we describe that feeling of our brain thinking it's a different time than it actually

274
00:14:44,650 --> 00:14:45,100
is.
