1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:07,740
Now we should feel very comfortable with a lot of words and phrases related to time and duration prepositions

2
00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:09,120
that are very common.

3
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:14,520
Let's now get into a little bit more complexity although still pretty easy.

4
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:21,740
Still pretty basic and how we can talk about a range a range of times you've probably seen this before.

5
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:24,840
When should we use from to when should we use.

6
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:27,960
Between and they mean the same thing.

7
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:33,290
It's just about how you use them from goes with to between goes with N..

8
00:00:33,330 --> 00:00:36,440
Just remember that and you're pretty much OK.

9
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:42,970
You can use it to talk about both of these to talk about months years times.

10
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:46,790
So it's extremely useful as long as you feel comfortable using these.

11
00:00:46,790 --> 00:00:52,350
We're talking about a range beginning here now that I know that a lot of the ending here.

12
00:00:52,390 --> 00:01:04,200
OK so let's try it from June 8th 2014 to July 17th 2014.

13
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:11,730
The Web site will be down OK from June 8 2014 to July 17th 2014.

14
00:01:11,730 --> 00:01:14,060
The Web site will be down.

15
00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:19,950
One thing we can do here when we're talking about this range this range when the Web site will be down

16
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:25,980
or not working is that we can notice the year here and here these two are the same if they're different

17
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:27,310
we have to say both.

18
00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:32,760
In fact we can probably leave out the second one and we usually do that when we're reading a list of

19
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:36,720
things which has the same noun for each one.

20
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:41,400
I want to eat Italian food Spanish food French food and Indian food.

21
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:47,140
Or we could just say one of those I want to eat Italian French Indian and Spanish food.

22
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:47,560
OK.

23
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:53,250
Now for this one we could go from June 8th to July 17th 2014.

24
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:58,890
The Web site will be down from June 8th 2000 14th to July 17th.

25
00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:00,270
The Web site will be down.

26
00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:01,270
That's OK too.

27
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:01,800
That's OK.

28
00:02:01,810 --> 00:02:08,550
2 for for things like food it would be the second one or the last one and for the dates or the times

29
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:11,710
it can be it can be either one honestly.

30
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:15,020
Now how can we do this with between an end.

31
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:16,890
Well it's it's pretty easy.

32
00:02:16,890 --> 00:02:27,340
I would say between between June 8th 2014 and July 17th that's it.

33
00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:28,960
Everything else is the same.

34
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:30,620
So it's exactly the same.

35
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:36,540
The only difference is this one has two and this one has and they're both talking about a period of

36
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:37,080
time.

37
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:51,860
Now let's let's just do a quick example with actual times we are only open from 4:00 p.m. to 7:00 p.m.

38
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:58,590
And if someone is speaking this they probably won't say p.m. they'll probably just say we are only open

39
00:02:58,590 --> 00:03:03,910
from four to seven because no place is open from 4:00 a.m. to 7:00 a.m..

40
00:03:03,930 --> 00:03:07,560
Well maybe some fast food restaurants.

41
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:15,440
We could also then say we are only open between four and seven.

42
00:03:15,450 --> 00:03:16,550
You get the idea.

43
00:03:16,650 --> 00:03:28,110
You get the idea pretty simple pretty basic same thing four years from 2013 to two thousand eighteen.

44
00:03:28,350 --> 00:03:30,320
Then you can say something that happened.

45
00:03:30,390 --> 00:03:32,750
Mary was living in Canada.

46
00:03:32,850 --> 00:03:34,220
Whatever you want to say there.

47
00:03:34,230 --> 00:03:34,680
OK.

48
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:35,850
So this is pretty simple.

49
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:37,080
Exactly the same.

50
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:42,030
Just need to remember which one goes with and which one goes with two.
