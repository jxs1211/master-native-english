1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:06,090
So if we're clear on those basics let's go on to some other basics before we get into some slightly

2
00:00:06,090 --> 00:00:07,490
more difficult stuff.

3
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:14,490
Some phrases I want to just make sure you're absolutely clear on these basic prepositions at by around

4
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:17,580
about and within their basic their basic.

5
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:20,020
But we need to make sure we're clear on how to use them.

6
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:22,490
Let's just burn through some examples.

7
00:00:22,490 --> 00:00:24,810
That means we're going to go really fast.

8
00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:25,680
Here we go.

9
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:30,410
That is for exactly when something happens on the clock usually.

10
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:35,520
So at 7:00 at 7:00 p.m. a.m. whatever.

11
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:36,670
I have a meeting.

12
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:38,720
I have a meeting.

13
00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:39,180
OK.

14
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:40,880
Pretty simple at 7:00.

15
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:43,400
Could be another time could be at 7:00.

16
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:45,630
Seven twenty three whatever.

17
00:00:45,630 --> 00:00:47,400
Why would you do something at seven.

18
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:48,460
Twenty three.

19
00:00:48,530 --> 00:00:50,450
Anyway at seven I have a meeting.

20
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:50,850
OK.

21
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:55,630
Please give it to me by Friday.

22
00:00:55,650 --> 00:00:56,490
This one's interesting.

23
00:00:56,490 --> 00:01:01,560
What does bi mean BI is like before plus on.

24
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:06,300
If you say give it to me on Friday it means Thursday Wednesday.

25
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:13,080
These are not OK if you say give it to me before Friday means Friday is not OK anytime before.

26
00:01:13,090 --> 00:01:13,420
OK.

27
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:14,290
Not Friday.

28
00:01:14,370 --> 00:01:19,050
If you say give it to me by Friday it means Wednesday Thursday Friday.

29
00:01:19,050 --> 00:01:19,940
They're all OK.

30
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:21,300
Including Friday.

31
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:24,870
So buy is really useful if you say I'll be there by 6:00.

32
00:01:24,870 --> 00:01:29,190
It means no later than 6:00 no later than six.

33
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:31,230
Could be five thirty could be five 20.

34
00:01:31,230 --> 00:01:34,540
Could be 558 could be six including six.

35
00:01:34,570 --> 00:01:37,020
OK so if we say then around.

36
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:45,640
If I if I say I'll be there I'll be there around six thirty.

37
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:50,370
This is very then mysterious six thirty is like this.

38
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:53,210
Oh when is it exactly.

39
00:01:53,210 --> 00:01:54,350
Is it six twenty.

40
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:55,640
Is it six fifteen.

41
00:01:55,650 --> 00:01:57,060
Is it six twenty five.

42
00:01:57,060 --> 00:01:58,240
Is it six thirty.

43
00:01:58,260 --> 00:01:59,690
Is it six forty.

44
00:01:59,690 --> 00:02:01,380
Yeah all around that.

45
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:03,810
So around and about are very similar.

46
00:02:03,810 --> 00:02:07,280
They're often used in this way to be less clear.

47
00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:08,970
It's not as clear as at.

48
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:15,060
And it's not as clear as bi because at least by bi we know what the latest time is.

49
00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:21,690
So we can say around when we want to be general when we want to be general and we often use around and

50
00:02:21,690 --> 00:02:24,510
about when we're talking about our memory.

51
00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:34,350
For example I could say at at about 5:00 we went out to eat.

52
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:36,380
That was maybe yesterday at about 5:00.

53
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:43,090
We went out to eat about we could also say we could also use around five as well.

54
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:43,770
That's fine.

55
00:02:43,770 --> 00:02:45,410
We could say about we could say around.

56
00:02:45,450 --> 00:02:48,000
That means that my memory is not so clear.

57
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:51,620
I wasn't checking my watch when we left to go out to eat.

58
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:56,000
Maybe I and some of my co-workers went out to eat.

59
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:57,810
When did we go on the food.

60
00:02:58,060 --> 00:02:59,220
I was around.

61
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:01,710
I was around five maybe about five.

62
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:02,150
OK.

63
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:03,390
So that's how we use that.

64
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:04,520
Either we're going to be late.

65
00:03:04,530 --> 00:03:10,380
We don't know when we're going to arrive or we don't remember very clearly about around.

66
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:12,470
OK now what about within here.

67
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:21,680
We have within within 20 minutes everyone was asleep OK.

68
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:32,960
So if we say everyone was asleep by 6:00 20 we arrived home at 6:00 and everyone was asleep by a 6 20.

69
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:37,710
That means the last person to fall asleep maybe fell asleep at 6 19.

70
00:03:37,790 --> 00:03:40,830
Anyway six twenty everyone was sleeping OK.

71
00:03:40,890 --> 00:03:49,970
So before or at six 20 but if we say within 20 minutes then we're talking about this duration this period.

72
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:51,970
Do you are 80 I O N.

73
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,550
All right that more clearly because that's not very clear D.

74
00:03:54,580 --> 00:04:01,380
You are a t i o n this duration of time is not a time on the clock.

75
00:04:01,390 --> 00:04:09,400
Usually it's often how many minutes how many hours 20 minutes within 20 minutes everyone was asleep.

76
00:04:09,490 --> 00:04:17,910
That means maybe the first person fell asleep at 6 0 5 the second person fell asleep at maybe 6 10.

77
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:20,100
The third person fell asleep at 6 12.

78
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:27,180
The fourth person fell asleep at 6 17 and the last person fell asleep at 6 20.

79
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:31,060
So within 20 minutes so we can use it like that.

80
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:33,220
Talk about durations time periods.

81
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:38,980
I hope it's clear how we use at by around about and within to talk about time.

82
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:40,590
This is pretty easy stuff.

83
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:41,170
I know.

84
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:47,650
Just want to make sure it's very very clear in your mind so that you have no doubt when you want to

85
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:51,220
actually use them.
