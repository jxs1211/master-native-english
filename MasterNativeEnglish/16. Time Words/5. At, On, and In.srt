1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:05,450
So now we're pretty clear on how we use those basic prepositions to talk about times.

2
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:15,840
Now we can talk about days months weeks dates years decades using often these three at on and in.

3
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:20,690
Now at is for a specific time just like when we say six thirty.

4
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:27,180
But add is often used for a point within a year or a month or a week.

5
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:34,410
For example at the beginning of June at the beginning of next month.

6
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:35,240
OK.

7
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:41,190
At the end of the week we can use app for that.

8
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:47,680
It's sort of a time point within a within a larger thing a larger unit.

9
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:54,300
OK how about on then on is actually more common when we're talking about days and days if it's an exact

10
00:00:54,300 --> 00:01:02,200
date we won't say at June 13th we say on June 13th on June 13th.

11
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:04,430
I flew home.

12
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:05,110
That's it.

13
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:06,960
There on June 13th.

14
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:12,960
I flew home on February 20 seventh on July 6th on August 24th.

15
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:14,140
What ever.

16
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:15,540
Well we say a specific date.

17
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:17,670
We use on OK.

18
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:25,890
We also use on when we say for example the actual day of the week on Friday of last week or this week

19
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:26,880
on Friday.

20
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:29,370
I I have a match.

21
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:30,940
Maybe you're a tennis player.

22
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:32,760
When is your match is on Friday.

23
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:34,200
Oh OK.

24
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:42,540
What do you usually do on the weekend.

25
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:44,510
Do you usually do on the weekend.

26
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:46,740
What do you usually do on weekends.

27
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:51,260
So for a weekend even though it's two days some people consider it three days.

28
00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:53,120
We use on as well.

29
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:54,870
We don't use at for the weekends.

30
00:01:54,870 --> 00:01:56,670
We don't use in for the weekends.

31
00:01:56,670 --> 00:01:58,180
We don't stay in the weekends.

32
00:01:58,230 --> 00:02:02,910
We can stay in the week we can say during the week for the whole thing.

33
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:04,610
You could say during the weekend.

34
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:07,570
But usually we say on the weekend and then in.

35
00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:17,260
Is used for much larger things we'll say for example in April we need to book our hotel.

36
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,670
That's when we need to do it in April.

37
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,920
So we're talking about the whole month of April.

38
00:02:21,930 --> 00:02:23,460
Whenever it happens.

39
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:24,250
OK.

40
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:31,120
If it's a larger thing in 2014 I moved to Austria.

41
00:02:31,190 --> 00:02:31,750
Why.

42
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:32,550
Why not.

43
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:32,970
Why not.

44
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:36,170
Why not move to Austria in 2014.

45
00:02:36,210 --> 00:02:39,420
I moved to Austria out in the 90s.

46
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:46,560
Now we're talking about a decade which is a 10 year period in the 90s in the 80s in the 70s in the 60s.

47
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:54,550
Well if we go back 100 years then we start and we need to start saying 18 70s 80s 90s 14 20s.

48
00:02:54,660 --> 00:03:03,690
But if we're talking about the the previous century then we just use 90s in the 90s in the 90s fashion

49
00:03:04,230 --> 00:03:07,250
was weird.

50
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:08,390
It's true.

51
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:11,180
I guess fashion is always weird when you look back though right.

52
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:15,810
What I'm wearing now my hair probably will be weird very soon maybe it's weird now.

53
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:16,940
I don't know.

54
00:03:16,950 --> 00:03:17,190
All right.

55
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:24,350
So that's how we use at on and in when we're talking about days dates months years decades.

56
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:25,380
Things like that.

57
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:27,590
Hope that's pretty easy to understand.

58
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:28,140
Should be.
