1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:06,320
All right so we're moving right along on our phrases and words that we used to talk about time.

2
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:11,820
I know a lot of this stuff is simple but I hope the examples helped to make it super clear for you so

3
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:14,340
that you don't have to think twice when you're using them.

4
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:15,810
Now let's look at back then.

5
00:00:15,810 --> 00:00:23,010
And at that time which are basically the same and we use these two phrases when we want to reference

6
00:00:23,190 --> 00:00:30,620
a time that happened before in the past usually usually long ago Long ago.

7
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:30,950
OK.

8
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:39,420
So for example I mentioned the eighteen forties and then I say something after that about that time

9
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:42,510
I would say back then is more common.

10
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:49,380
One thing that's important to notice and pay attention to about back then is that you've already mentioned

11
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:50,740
the time first.

12
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:56,760
You can't start with back then because people will then say back when what are you talking about.

13
00:00:56,790 --> 00:01:03,180
What you have to first say the time you have to first mentioned the time or the time period and then

14
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,860
and then you can use back then.

15
00:01:05,910 --> 00:01:12,240
And that's also how at that time is typically used although at that time can be used to talk about the

16
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:14,940
future and we'll do an example of that too.

17
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:27,420
OK so let's let's get into an example then my my great grandfather was born in nineteen oh for nineteen

18
00:01:27,510 --> 00:01:28,430
oh four.

19
00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:30,590
Long time ago back then.

20
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:38,010
Back then comma cars were not popular.

21
00:01:38,010 --> 00:01:45,960
Notice I've said when I'm talking about first I've now made a new sentence and said back then this is

22
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:47,150
usually how it's done.

23
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:50,680
This is not for something that happened last week.

24
00:01:50,730 --> 00:01:57,320
It's usually years ago years ago not even months ago years ago many many years ago often.

25
00:01:57,450 --> 00:02:01,610
So we can use it to talk about our childhood for example.

26
00:02:01,790 --> 00:02:03,560
I grew up in the 90s.

27
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:09,360
Back then we didn't really have the internet back then we didn't really have the internet.

28
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,940
I grew up in the 90s back then.

29
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:17,430
Back then we didn't have the Internet.

30
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:23,340
Now if you're the person watching this thinking wait a second we had the internet in the 90s.

31
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:24,400
OK that's true.

32
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:29,990
But when I was a kid in the 90s it wasn't a popular thing like it is now.

33
00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:30,970
Yes it's true.

34
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:33,770
It was there but not many people used it.

35
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:41,880
Common people used it for everyday things to buy whatever buy stuff watch movies like we do now in the

36
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:53,600
nineteen thirties the USA experienced tough economic times tough economic times.

37
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:54,290
All right.

38
00:02:54,330 --> 00:03:01,710
At that time and we could also say back then here at that time getting a job notice I have a comma here

39
00:03:02,010 --> 00:03:06,940
getting a job was not easy.

40
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,590
OK back then getting a job was not easy.

41
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:10,860
All right.

42
00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:14,160
So pretty simple these two back then at that time.

43
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:21,450
I just want to be clear that we can use at that time in more places but I also want to be clear that

44
00:03:21,450 --> 00:03:27,180
when we're talking about the past I would say back then is more common.

45
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:33,450
I feel like I hear it much more often than saying at that time but you can use at that time in the future

46
00:03:33,510 --> 00:03:44,940
for example the speaker will talk until seven thirty at that time people can ask questions.

47
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:45,260
OK.

48
00:03:45,270 --> 00:03:49,010
So here at that time is about the future.

49
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:50,280
So it's a bit more general.

50
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:54,260
It can be used in more places but that doesn't mean it's more common.

51
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:57,200
I feel like back then is much more common.

52
00:03:57,330 --> 00:03:58,380
I hear it more often.
