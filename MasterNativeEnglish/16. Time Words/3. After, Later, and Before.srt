1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:05,340
So now we can get into after later and before we can't use it from now.

2
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:08,590
So let's just cross that out.

3
00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:15,390
We're not going to use that after it later and before can be used to talk about a time that happened

4
00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:23,580
after or before a point that's in the future or the past future or past.

5
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:24,930
So here's the point.

6
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:25,710
Here's the point.

7
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:30,420
And we're going to talk about something that happened over here or something that happened over here

8
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:32,850
or something that happened over here.

9
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:34,530
Something that happened over here.

10
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:35,980
Not now.

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,760
We're not going to focus on now.

12
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:50,790
OK so let's say future or past future or past point It works basically the same way as in an ago except

13
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:57,780
now point is moved into the future or moved into the past and we don't talk about now some examples.

14
00:00:57,780 --> 00:00:58,200
OK.

15
00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:00,370
Let's go simple at first.

16
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:00,980
OK.

17
00:01:00,990 --> 00:01:14,010
A week before my vacation next June I need to get my visa if I wanted to be very specific about the

18
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:17,960
time I could say in six months I'm going on vacation.

19
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:18,360
OK.

20
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:25,770
A week before my vacation which is in six months which is next June whatever I need to get my visa.

21
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:26,030
OK.

22
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:28,530
So this is June.

23
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:29,860
In the future.

24
00:01:29,860 --> 00:01:30,340
OK.

25
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:33,780
And this is a week before that.

26
00:01:33,870 --> 00:01:34,950
One week before.

27
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:35,720
Here's now.

28
00:01:35,730 --> 00:01:37,130
We don't worry about that.

29
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:38,490
A week before that.

30
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:41,600
I need to get my visa which is what we need to travel.

31
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:44,670
Obviously when we travel we need a visa.

32
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:45,150
OK.

33
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:47,640
So that makes sense.

34
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:49,760
We could say there's another pass point.

35
00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:53,600
Let's say this is my 11th birthday bidet.

36
00:01:53,610 --> 00:01:54,620
We often write bidet.

37
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:55,050
OK.

38
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:57,860
Three months after my 11th birthday.

39
00:01:57,870 --> 00:02:00,450
Well it's not my 11th birthday now.

40
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:07,700
So my 11th birthday was over 70 years ago three months after my 11th birthday.

41
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:17,400
I broke my leg three months after my 11th birthday I broke my leg three months before my 11th birthday.

42
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:22,590
Three months before my 11th birthday I moved to a new city.

43
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:25,260
I moved to a new city with my family.

44
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:25,680
OK.

45
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:35,970
But again it's from this point from this point or I could say I turned eleven on June 14th six months

46
00:02:36,210 --> 00:02:37,920
later something happened.

47
00:02:38,230 --> 00:02:38,890
OK.

48
00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:39,810
Pretty simple.

49
00:02:39,810 --> 00:02:48,690
I had moved to a new city a month before.

50
00:02:48,690 --> 00:02:50,650
So that's how we can use before.

51
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:51,460
Before what.

52
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:57,350
Well before I turned eleven a month before I turned eleven which was on June 14th for example.

53
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:57,850
OK.

54
00:02:58,110 --> 00:02:59,560
A few more examples.

55
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:06,230
After after getting married I became more responsible.

56
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:11,910
Now that one's not connected to a specific date but I was married in the past and then after that time

57
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:13,900
probably until now.

58
00:03:14,010 --> 00:03:20,190
Maybe maybe not after that time I changed so we can use this way to express it.

59
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:23,700
So the point there is we can use events instead of dates.

60
00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:34,380
For example in the future after I move to New York City NYC they also call that the Big Apple.

61
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:42,450
After I moved to New York City I plan to start small business.

62
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:47,940
So this one is not about when it happens exactly but there's a thing that's going to happen in the future

63
00:03:47,970 --> 00:03:52,350
not now and then another thing that will happen after that you could say something that will happen

64
00:03:52,350 --> 00:03:54,540
before that we don't need to say the dates.

65
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:59,540
We don't need to say exactly when we're just trying to relate events in time.

66
00:03:59,550 --> 00:04:06,960
Basically I arrived in Beijing in 2012 a year later.

67
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:10,670
I met my wife a year later.

68
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:11,870
I met my wife.

69
00:04:11,890 --> 00:04:13,650
OK so this is when it happened.

70
00:04:13,650 --> 00:04:16,080
Could I use for example before here.

71
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:16,660
Well yeah.

72
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:20,010
Could say a year before I met my wife.

73
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:21,650
I moved to Beijing.

74
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:25,940
Basically it's the same idea the same idea.

75
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:40,520
If you're hungry before 5 p.m. You'll have to cook by yourself before we have to cook by yourself.

76
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:40,970
So OK.

77
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:42,990
Maybe a mother is talking to her son.

78
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:44,550
Usually she cooks for her son.

79
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:45,390
Today she can't.

80
00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:46,560
Maybe she's very busy.

81
00:04:46,830 --> 00:04:49,250
If you feel hungry this is in the future.

82
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:50,910
Maybe now it's 2 p.m..

83
00:04:50,910 --> 00:04:54,630
Son if you feel hungry before 5 you'll have to cook for yourself.

84
00:04:54,930 --> 00:04:59,190
OK so so that means if it's after she will cook for him.

85
00:04:59,190 --> 00:05:05,550
If this is 5 p.m. after it OK she will cook for him before she cannot she cannot.

86
00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:09,120
She will be busy so he will have to cook for himself before that.

87
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:10,050
This is in the future.

88
00:05:10,050 --> 00:05:11,700
One more thing very quickly.

89
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:19,890
I have so much to prepare before my exam.

90
00:05:19,890 --> 00:05:22,650
I have so much to prepare before my exam.

91
00:05:22,650 --> 00:05:28,760
I'm really stressed out I'm stressed out out and out OK.

92
00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:30,320
So hopefully that's clear now.

93
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:34,880
When we use in when we use a go when we use after later and before.

94
00:05:34,890 --> 00:05:36,270
I hope it's very clear.
