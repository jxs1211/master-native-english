1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:04,400
Moving quickly along we've talked about a lot of basic words and prepositions.

2
00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:07,740
Let's just be clear about since ever since and until.

3
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:14,250
Because they're kind of the same idea when we use sense and ever since we have this beginning point

4
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:22,510
in the past and it's going until probably now and we'll continue in the future likely on until means

5
00:00:22,530 --> 00:00:29,530
something was continuing before and it ends at some point doesn't have to be now.

6
00:00:29,610 --> 00:00:35,820
Doesn't have to be the future doesn't have to be the past but it could be any one of those now since

7
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:36,780
and ever since.

8
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:41,360
Can often be used in the same way especially if it's at the beginning of a sentence.

9
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:52,080
We would say for example since since I was a little boy I've I've been interested in the moon and I

10
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:57,310
could then say ever since I was a little boy I've been interested in the moon.

11
00:00:57,330 --> 00:01:04,950
We often use ever since when we're talking about events things that happen in time in the past that

12
00:01:04,950 --> 00:01:07,410
have continued until the present.

13
00:01:07,410 --> 00:01:09,630
That's often how it's used.

14
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:13,070
Another example of ever since ever since.

15
00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:17,150
Ever since my grandmother passed away.

16
00:01:17,190 --> 00:01:19,820
That means died but passed away is often more polite.

17
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:21,090
I haven't been the same.

18
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:24,300
Now could we say since my grandmother passed away I haven't been the same.

19
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:24,780
Yeah.

20
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:25,140
Yeah.

21
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:27,410
You could say that but they're both events.

22
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:35,130
They're both things that happened in the past and they're focusing on some event not specifically some

23
00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:35,800
time.

24
00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:44,760
We often then use since only for time things and wouldn't use ever since so often for specific time

25
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:45,060
things.

26
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:49,160
For example we wouldn't say ever since 2011.

27
00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:54,720
We would more often say since 2011 but again it's a it's a small distinction.

28
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:56,180
They're very very similar.

29
00:01:56,190 --> 00:02:00,000
Let's look at a couple of examples of just since.

30
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,030
Let us do that since June.

31
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:10,060
Since June things have been very strange.

32
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:15,020
Maybe in a family or whatever since June things have been very strange.

33
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:20,420
We probably won't use ever since they're probably just use since June since June.

34
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:29,620
Or we could say for example I haven't eaten since 4 a. m..

35
00:02:30,370 --> 00:02:30,530
OK.

36
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:37,480
We would definitely won't use ever since here cannot work here can not use ever since I haven't eaten

37
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,310
ever since 4:00 AM.

38
00:02:39,310 --> 00:02:40,620
That is incorrect.

39
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:47,200
We can use just since when we have this sentence structure and we mentioned a specific time like this.

40
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:47,420
OK.

41
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:53,890
So if we have a time of day then we won't use ever since again ever since can be used to focus on usually

42
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:59,410
distant events in the past and to talk about some current condition.

43
00:02:59,410 --> 00:03:00,610
And when it began.

44
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:03,380
Whereas senses used for simpler things.

45
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:12,100
Let's look at one more example of since since Tuesday the office has been very quiet since Tuesday the

46
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:13,860
office has been very quiet.

47
00:03:13,890 --> 00:03:17,370
Now you could use ever since there you really could.

48
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:23,950
But yeah again usually since we'll be used there because it's about a specific time.

49
00:03:23,950 --> 00:03:25,630
It's just a bit more common.

50
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:28,720
So there is some overlap with sense and ever since.

51
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:34,240
But just to be clear this sort of thing when we're talking about a time of day especially in this sentence

52
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:39,290
structure we can not use ever since until.

53
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:46,540
I will stay until you ask me to leave.

54
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:47,330
OK.

55
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:48,090
Pretty simple.

56
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:50,330
That means when you say it's time for you to go.

57
00:03:50,350 --> 00:03:50,850
I will.

58
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:51,640
OK.

59
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:53,350
I will go if you don't say it.

60
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:54,380
I won't go.

61
00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:54,620
OK.

62
00:03:54,670 --> 00:03:56,880
I will stay until you ask me to leave.

63
00:03:56,890 --> 00:04:00,160
We could take this out and we could just put a time here.

64
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:01,660
I will stay until 10 p.m..

65
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:03,400
Very simple very simple.

66
00:04:03,430 --> 00:04:04,330
This is easy.

67
00:04:04,330 --> 00:04:06,930
This is just the ending time.

68
00:04:07,050 --> 00:04:15,250
OK breakfast isn't served until 7:00 a.m. until 7:00 a.m..

69
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:17,470
Notice that sometimes we use time.

70
00:04:17,470 --> 00:04:19,500
Sometimes we can use days dates.

71
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:21,730
We can say months until June.

72
00:04:21,730 --> 00:04:24,310
It's not going to be ready until June.

73
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:25,920
I can't wait that long.

74
00:04:25,930 --> 00:04:28,610
That's three months from now.

75
00:04:28,690 --> 00:04:31,490
So that's the time in the future when it will happen.

76
00:04:31,510 --> 00:04:37,230
But time of day also works and events also work until you ask me to leave.

77
00:04:37,230 --> 00:04:37,830
OK.

78
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:42,490
She was very happy until John brought up her dead dog.

79
00:04:42,630 --> 00:04:44,330
Then she started crying again.

80
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:49,540
Or he was very sad until Cheryl came over and gave him a hug.

81
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:51,490
So you can talk about events too.

82
00:04:51,490 --> 00:04:52,060
OK.

83
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:54,210
Pretty simple pretty easy I think.

84
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:56,790
I think you can probably understand as well.

85
00:04:56,790 --> 00:05:02,210
And I hope that you feel comfortable and confident to use since ever since and until.

86
00:05:02,210 --> 00:05:03,130
And let's go on.
