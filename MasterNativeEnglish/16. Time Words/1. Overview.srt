1
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:11,460
In the last lesson we worked on some of the things that we can do some of the exercises we can do to

2
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:19,110
practice to improve our ability to think in English and to improve our speaking and writing habits.

3
00:00:19,110 --> 00:00:25,800
In this lesson we're going to be focused on time words that means words that we can use that are related

4
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:30,120
to time that we need to use when we talk about time things in the past.

5
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:31,220
Things in the future.

6
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:36,960
Now I know that you're familiar with a lot of these words like in an ago and after later prepositions

7
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:41,450
like apt and by and around phrases like maybe back then.

8
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:48,390
But I want to make sure we go over them in this course so that to you there crystal clear that means

9
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:49,850
you completely understand them.

10
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:51,570
You know the differences between them.

11
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:53,460
You know exactly how to use them.

12
00:00:53,550 --> 00:01:01,110
If you completely understand all of these and you know exactly how to use them OK perhaps you can skip

13
00:01:01,110 --> 00:01:02,390
over this lesson.

14
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:08,160
I would recommend going through it because we're going to cover lots of examples lots and lots of great

15
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:12,900
examples for how to tell the difference how to know the difference between these words and phrases very

16
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:14,630
importantly how to use them.
