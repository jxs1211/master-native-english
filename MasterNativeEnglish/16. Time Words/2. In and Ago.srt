1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:02,510
So let's get started with in a go.

2
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:11,250
One of the most common issues that I've seen with English learners is mixing up in and go with after

3
00:00:11,310 --> 00:00:14,000
AND before and later we can't get these mixed up.

4
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:19,900
We use in and go in one type of situation and the others in a different one.

5
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:23,400
So let's just be very clear about how we use it and to go.

6
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:24,660
So this is our timeline.

7
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:30,930
It's called Is Our timeline and this is now the present this moment if we're talking about something

8
00:00:30,930 --> 00:00:38,420
from now then we should use in if it's in the future and to go for the past.

9
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:41,690
So this way the future we'll use in again.

10
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:46,880
This is from now from now we can't say for example we can't say after 10 minutes.

11
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:54,840
And that means from now 10 minutes we need to say in 10 minutes in the past we use a go from now.

12
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:56,950
We can't say 10 minutes before.

13
00:00:57,030 --> 00:00:59,950
Now we can't say that we have to say 10 minutes ago.

14
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:08,040
It doesn't matter how much time it is it can be 100 years 50 years a week a month 10 months a minute

15
00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:10,530
a second doesn't matter from now.

16
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:11,190
OK.

17
00:01:11,190 --> 00:01:13,320
Some examples some examples.

18
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:19,540
The plane plane will land in 10.

19
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:23,460
I'm just going to write the abbreviation M I N S 10 minutes.

20
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:23,820
OK.

21
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:29,720
My plane my plane left ten minutes ago.

22
00:01:29,730 --> 00:01:34,950
OK so the first one the plane will leave in 10 minutes or will land and 10 minutes sorry the plane will

23
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:37,960
land in 10 minutes means I'm sitting here waiting.

24
00:01:37,980 --> 00:01:47,160
The plane is going to in the future from now 10 minutes my plane left 10 minutes ago that means I'm

25
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:48,090
late.

26
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:51,890
I ran to the airport and it didn't make it.

27
00:01:51,930 --> 00:01:57,220
I'm late for my plane I'm late for my flight because it left 10 minutes ago.

28
00:01:57,420 --> 00:01:57,920
OK.

29
00:01:57,970 --> 00:01:59,510
Again that's from now.

30
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:04,040
That's from now in 15 years.

31
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:09,790
I hope to be living in Sweden.

32
00:02:09,790 --> 00:02:10,830
OK Sweden.

33
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:11,800
I don't know why Sweden.

34
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:12,500
Who knows.

35
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:15,840
In 15 years I hope to be living in Sweden.

36
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:16,040
OK.

37
00:02:16,050 --> 00:02:24,750
So that's in the future maybe this is 2015 and this is 2030 from now if it's 2015.

38
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:30,150
Actually it's not from now 30 15 years to 2030.

39
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:31,940
It's very important that it's from now.

40
00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:34,230
Doesn't matter how much time it is.

41
00:02:34,230 --> 00:02:35,060
Doesn't matter.

42
00:02:35,070 --> 00:02:35,540
OK.

43
00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:44,400
I was living in Ohio four years ago.

44
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:48,300
I was living in Ohio four years ago.

45
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:51,720
So from now if we go back one two three four years.

46
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:53,490
Where was I Ohio.

47
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:54,580
I was living there.

48
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:57,920
OK actually that's also not true.

49
00:02:58,170 --> 00:02:59,210
Just examples.

50
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:02,130
I hope that's clear in the future from now.

51
00:03:02,130 --> 00:03:03,660
Go to the past.

52
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:04,680
From now.
