1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:00,640
OK.

2
00:00:00,650 --> 00:00:06,030
So in this lesson we've been talking about lots of different time words and phrases.

3
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:10,450
And now we're down to the very last one whenever and every time.

4
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:16,650
Basically this means there's an event here an event here an event here an event here.

5
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:23,130
And each one of these events has a thing that happens in all cases.

6
00:00:23,190 --> 00:00:26,090
It's not like there's an event event event event.

7
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:31,670
And this one this one and this one have something happen but not this one.

8
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:32,030
OK.

9
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:38,700
No then we can't use whenever or every time if we want to use whenever or every time it has to be all

10
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:39,410
of them.

11
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:44,940
For example whenever I teach a class I make a plan.

12
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:47,460
Whenever I teach a class I make a plan.

13
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:52,020
That means there are no times when I don't make a plan.

14
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:53,420
I always have a plan.

15
00:00:53,490 --> 00:00:54,930
I always have an outline.

16
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:56,580
I know what I'm going to talk about.

17
00:00:56,610 --> 00:01:00,000
I don't just come out and go blah blah blah and start talking.

18
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,280
OK let's look at some examples of this.

19
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:07,050
It's a pretty easy concept whenever and every time are basically the same.

20
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:09,660
Whenever I feel is more common.

21
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:11,590
But every time is ok too.

22
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:23,130
Whenever whenever I visit New York City I go to Danny's pizza in Queens and Danny's pizza in Queens.

23
00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:23,630
Very good.

24
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:24,720
Very tasty.

25
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:25,320
You're welcome.

26
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:28,480
Danny's pizza for the free advertised man.

27
00:01:28,490 --> 00:01:30,570
Seriously it's a place in Queens.

28
00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:34,440
It has amazing pizza the best pizza in the world in my opinion.

29
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:40,670
OK so that means there are no times that I go to New York and don't visit Danny's pizza.

30
00:01:40,670 --> 00:01:41,090
OK.

31
00:01:41,190 --> 00:01:47,460
I could also say every time I visit New York City I go to Danny's pizza in Queens.

32
00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:52,140
Another example every time we have class I see you improving.

33
00:01:52,260 --> 00:01:56,430
We could say whenever we have class I see you improving every time.

34
00:01:56,430 --> 00:01:56,830
OK.

35
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:02,730
So in these cases we can see that every time and whenever are the same but are they ever different.

36
00:02:02,730 --> 00:02:09,510
The answer is yes we can use whenever also to mean any time or I don't care.

37
00:02:09,510 --> 00:02:12,480
Just choose a time and that's OK with me.

38
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:16,110
For example one friend says to another what time.

39
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:19,890
What time should we should we leave.

40
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:21,050
What time should we leave.

41
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:23,970
One friend is asking to another friend the other Francis.

42
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:29,810
Whenever that means I don't care when any time is up to you.

43
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:31,590
We can't use every time here.

44
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:34,350
We can't say every time it doesn't work.

45
00:02:34,350 --> 00:02:35,120
It doesn't work.

46
00:02:35,130 --> 00:02:42,990
So this is a place where whenever has a meaning or a use that doesn't include every time it doesn't

47
00:02:42,990 --> 00:02:49,320
include every time there's also a situation when we would use every time but not whenever and it's usually

48
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:50,600
at the end of a sentence.

49
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:56,670
For example I'm not looking forward to going to New York.

50
00:02:57,240 --> 00:03:03,780
So why can you imagine I get lost every time.

51
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:10,440
So here is where we can use every time but not whenever I'm not looking forward to going to New York.

52
00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:13,170
I get lost every time.

53
00:03:13,170 --> 00:03:15,110
That means every time I go.

54
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:21,140
But we can end the sentence with every time and we couldn't just replace that with whenever I get lost

55
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:24,020
whenever it doesn't doesn't make sense.

56
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:26,250
We can say every time but not whenever there.

57
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:30,030
We could say I get lost when ever I go there.

58
00:03:30,090 --> 00:03:31,940
But then it's kind of a weird sentence.

59
00:03:31,950 --> 00:03:33,480
And we're saying too much.

60
00:03:33,570 --> 00:03:41,040
I get lost every time that we could add every time I do as well every time I do.

61
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,670
Every time I go there.

62
00:03:42,690 --> 00:03:50,060
But the nice thing about every time at the end of the sentence is that we can end that way.

63
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:52,320
I'm not looking forward to going to New York.

64
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:53,900
I get lost every time.

65
00:03:53,910 --> 00:03:58,940
It can also be used to answer a question that somebody asks and we can't use whenever.

66
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:09,930
Do you throw up when you drink rum answer every time not whenever we can't say whenever whenever can

67
00:04:09,930 --> 00:04:11,930
go into a whole sentence.

68
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:14,270
Whenever I drink rum I throw up.

69
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:15,240
That works.

70
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:19,300
But if we want to just answer the question with this every time we can.

71
00:04:19,410 --> 00:04:22,470
That's the answer every time yes every time.

72
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:26,140
Which means every time I drink rum I throw up.

73
00:04:26,150 --> 00:04:26,430
OK.

74
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:31,560
So hopefully that's clear the difference between whenever and every time.

75
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:31,860
All right.

76
00:04:31,890 --> 00:04:35,470
So we've gone through lots of words and phrases related to time.

77
00:04:35,490 --> 00:04:37,950
I hope that you found it very useful.

78
00:04:38,010 --> 00:04:43,530
Again these are all very common to really remember all the words and phrases that we've learned in this

79
00:04:43,530 --> 00:04:44,070
lesson.

80
00:04:44,070 --> 00:04:49,800
You've got to practice so write down all of the examples that we went through in this lesson.

81
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:54,220
I know there are many because we went through lots of different time words and phrases.

82
00:04:54,330 --> 00:04:57,640
Write them down and then make two sentences of your own.

83
00:04:57,660 --> 00:05:03,530
This will help to get them deeply grain in your mind so that when you need to speak and use them because

84
00:05:03,530 --> 00:05:09,080
they're very common they need to come out on a regular basis when you need to use them they will pop

85
00:05:09,170 --> 00:05:12,770
out of your mouth like nothing will be very easy.

86
00:05:12,790 --> 00:05:13,260
OK.

87
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:13,880
Good luck.
