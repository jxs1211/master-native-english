1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:04,050
While and during these have again very similar meanings.

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:09,780
One thing is happening and another thing is happening at the same time.

3
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:12,250
The thing is happening at the same time.

4
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:15,810
But there are some differences in the way that they're used.

5
00:00:15,810 --> 00:00:25,360
So while is often used when we're talking about two actions action one eating action to watching a movie.

6
00:00:25,870 --> 00:00:37,800
OK so that's the second action I usually eat something while watching a movie or watching movies a movie.

7
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:39,810
Movies TV shows whatever.

8
00:00:39,810 --> 00:00:42,490
OK so there's an action going on there.

9
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:52,740
And usually while is used when we want to talk about two actions happening at the same time two simultaneous

10
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:56,440
actions simultaneous is a very useful word.

11
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:59,650
It means two things happening at the same time.

12
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:03,900
I can also say simultaneously they were eating simultaneously.

13
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:09,570
It is a little bit formal though to be honest with you now for during during is a little different and

14
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:18,570
it's usually used for things that happen at the same time as a thing instead of another action.

15
00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:25,710
So for while you have usually two actions happening at the same time two things going on whereas during

16
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:33,340
is for a thing like a movie like a war like a meeting.

17
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:44,820
So it could say for example don't use your phone during the meeting don't use your phone during the

18
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:45,360
meeting.

19
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:47,040
So it's a thing here.

20
00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:48,150
It's a thing here.

21
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:50,870
We don't have to say two actions that happen.

22
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:58,120
A thing is going on a lot of people suffered during the war.

23
00:01:58,140 --> 00:01:59,540
War is no fun right.

24
00:01:59,550 --> 00:02:02,530
A lot of people suffered during the war.

25
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:05,070
No fun but it's a thing it's a thing.

26
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:09,870
I fell asleep during the movie.

27
00:02:09,870 --> 00:02:13,300
I fell asleep during the movie.

28
00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:17,450
Ok this one's also a very common thing that people say just a couple more examples.

29
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:23,280
One of these is a little bit different for a while so I just want to show you how wild can be used slightly

30
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:24,090
differently.

31
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:27,240
You can have a seat while you wait.

32
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:29,830
So that's two actions happening at the same time.

33
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:33,230
I should study while I have time.

34
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:33,410
OK.

35
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:35,570
So now that that's a little bit different.

36
00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:41,370
While I have time then the examples that we did earlier but it still works here.

37
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:45,150
So this is a common while I have time while you can.

38
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:48,130
This is another common phrase that uses while.

39
00:02:48,170 --> 00:02:48,740
OK.

40
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:53,880
And during the 90s a lot of Internet companies died died.

41
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:58,320
You could also say they went under they went under.

42
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:03,400
OK during that period of time the 90s the 90s is a noun it's a thing.

43
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:04,800
The 1990s.
