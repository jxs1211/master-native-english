1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:06,000
So usually when we're trying to get information from somebody whether it's calling the airport because

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,780
you lost your phone or maybe you're calling the owner of an apartment because maybe you'd like to take

3
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:18,800
a look or maybe you need to call about some tickets that you booked and you have a question.

4
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:19,510
Whatever.

5
00:00:19,530 --> 00:00:22,840
You probably never talked with that person before.

6
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:28,560
The person you're calling and so it's very important to be tactful being tactful is doing things in

7
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:32,490
a way which is respectful of others or or polite.

8
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:39,810
So let's look at a couple of really common phrases we can use when we want to ask for information in

9
00:00:39,810 --> 00:00:43,270
a tactful way or ask for information tactfully.

10
00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:48,130
So we could say I'm wondering instead of saying I want to know.

11
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:52,560
Or tell me now you can sometimes say Could you please tell me.

12
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:53,550
That's fine.

13
00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:57,130
Could you please tell me if that's totally OK.

14
00:00:57,210 --> 00:01:03,540
But sometimes if we say yes I want to know it can be a bit too too direct.

15
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:04,410
Right.

16
00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:10,900
Do you think you could tell me so instead of saying please tell me which is again OK.

17
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:13,720
Do you think you could tell me.

18
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:18,000
It's very this is very soft soft.

19
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:25,530
So this one I'm wondering I'm wondering if you could give me some information about the tickets the

20
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:33,060
prices for the tickets for tomorrow's concert at your venue a venue is where a concert is held.

21
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:41,190
I'm wondering do you think you could tell me the prices for Section C for the venue tomorrow and whether

22
00:01:41,190 --> 00:01:44,790
or not you have any tickets still available.

23
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:46,440
Do you think you could tell me.

24
00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:47,850
That's very very polite.

25
00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:52,450
So you have to keep in mind that one might be in some cases too polite.

26
00:01:52,460 --> 00:01:53,010
OK.

27
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:55,070
I'm trying to find out now.

28
00:01:55,110 --> 00:02:00,810
This is maybe when you would have asked several people before and not been successful you might use

29
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:01,460
this one.

30
00:02:01,470 --> 00:02:08,170
Yeah I'm trying to find out whether there are still any tickets available for the concert tomorrow.

31
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:10,590
But the last person I called didn't know.

32
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:12,550
So they gave me your number.

33
00:02:12,570 --> 00:02:16,850
I'm trying to find out if there are any tickets still available.

34
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:17,140
OK.

35
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:18,230
I'd like to know.

36
00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:19,670
I'd like to know.

37
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:20,210
Yeah.

38
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:26,130
I'd like to know if there are any tickets still available for the concert tomorrow night especially

39
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:27,610
in Section C.

40
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:34,710
OK this is a way to ask even though you're saying I'd like to know you're not really asking a question

41
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:38,080
but after you say what it is you'd like to know.

42
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:39,800
That means please tell me.

43
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:45,930
So by using I'd like to know even though it isn't a question they're going to tell you what you'd like

44
00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:48,230
to know if they know it.

45
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:50,510
So it's kind of suggested there.

46
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:54,780
It doesn't have to be a question and it's the same for it's the same for this one.

47
00:02:54,810 --> 00:02:55,170
Right.

48
00:02:55,170 --> 00:02:57,020
This is a question do you think.

49
00:02:57,050 --> 00:02:57,370
OK.

50
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:05,490
But these three one two three are all statements that are ways to say what we want in a polite way and

51
00:03:05,490 --> 00:03:07,310
then we get the information back.

52
00:03:07,350 --> 00:03:08,790
I'm inquiring about.

53
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:13,570
I'm inquiring about this one actually uses the word for today's topic.

54
00:03:13,570 --> 00:03:22,050
Yeah I'm inquiring about whether or not whether or not there are still tickets available for tomorrow's

55
00:03:22,110 --> 00:03:24,030
for tomorrow's concert.

56
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:24,720
Yes there are.

57
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:26,040
Oh that's great.

58
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:33,510
Now I'm wondering if you have any tickets available still in Section C in Section C.

59
00:03:33,930 --> 00:03:35,010
Oh yes we do actually.

60
00:03:35,010 --> 00:03:36,130
Oh that's great.

61
00:03:36,130 --> 00:03:36,900
Well that's great.

62
00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:42,020
I'd like to know I'd like to know the price of the tickets if that's possible.

63
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:47,970
So you can use these even if it's within one phone call within one situation you can use several of

64
00:03:47,970 --> 00:03:51,910
these as a way to get that information in a very polite way.

65
00:03:51,930 --> 00:03:57,900
And when you show others respect when you are tactful when you express things in a way which is a little

66
00:03:58,170 --> 00:04:05,310
less direct then usually people want to help you and they may even go out of their way for have room

67
00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:10,140
to write this out of their way to help you.

68
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:16,110
That means they might do more than they would normally do because you're being so so polite so respectful

69
00:04:16,110 --> 00:04:17,720
of their time right.

70
00:04:17,730 --> 00:04:28,080
Sometimes we can use a couple other phrases we could say someone goes above and beyond above and beyond

71
00:04:28,410 --> 00:04:32,700
for you or above and beyond what you you expect them to do right.

72
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:37,520
Or they they go the extra mile.

73
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:44,610
These two both mean that someone or you are willing to do more than what normally you or they would

74
00:04:44,610 --> 00:04:45,050
do.

75
00:04:45,150 --> 00:04:48,060
And for whatever reason you're a very helpful person.

76
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:54,300
So if someone remembers that person later let's say they worked and called five people to get me my

77
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:56,480
tickets and it was not easy for them.

78
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:57,930
They didn't have to do that.

79
00:04:57,990 --> 00:05:02,490
I could say well thank you for going the extra mile for me to get these tickets.

80
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:04,130
Really means a lot to me.

81
00:05:04,430 --> 00:05:05,850
I really appreciate that.

82
00:05:05,870 --> 00:05:08,250
It means a lot to me.

83
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:11,980
Aw thank you for going above and beyond.

84
00:05:11,990 --> 00:05:15,410
Aw she really went above and beyond to get me those tickets.

85
00:05:15,410 --> 00:05:22,760
I was really grateful all of these are common and basically the idea is when we have or or need to make

86
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:25,940
an inquiry we should be tactful.
