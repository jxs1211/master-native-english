1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:07,600
So we know the polite phrases when we're asking for information when we're making an inquiry or an inquiry.

2
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:15,780
And we now know how to if we need to call the landlord and make an inquiry or ask the landlord for more

3
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:20,110
information about the apartment before we go to look at it.

4
00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:24,420
Hopefully you feel very comfortable with that and you can actually do it.

5
00:00:24,450 --> 00:00:30,060
Now what I'd like to do is just quickly talk about some different ways you can say You're welcome.

6
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:35,900
After you thank somebody who has maybe given you information you need to say thank you.

7
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:37,710
And then they might say you're welcome.

8
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:38,750
You can say thanks.

9
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:44,940
You can say I appreciate it but let's look at different ways that people can say You're welcome.

10
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:48,050
These are the first ones are pretty informal.

11
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:54,620
So these are things you would say to your friends if you say sure sure sure.

12
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:55,290
Thanks a lot.

13
00:00:55,290 --> 00:00:55,860
Sure.

14
00:00:55,860 --> 00:00:57,320
Can I borrow a pen.

15
00:00:57,390 --> 00:00:58,730
Yes or Sure.

16
00:00:58,740 --> 00:00:59,220
Thanks.

17
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:00,940
Sure you can say it again.

18
00:01:00,990 --> 00:01:07,800
Sure can be used in many ways sometimes yep if it's very quick if you hold the door for somebody you

19
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:11,620
hold the door they go in they say oh thanks you go yep yep.

20
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:18,050
Very quick very informal not formal not formal.

21
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:18,670
OK.

22
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:19,230
How about.

23
00:01:19,230 --> 00:01:25,360
Of course this is a little bit more and you can use this in lots of different situations.

24
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:25,700
OK.

25
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:28,660
So hey do you think you could.

26
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:31,920
Do you think you could maybe help me with my homework.

27
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:34,670
Of course that means yes or Sure.

28
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:36,060
That means yes.

29
00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:37,680
And then I'll thank you so much.

30
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:40,340
Then you can again say of course.

31
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:41,850
So sometimes these mean both.

32
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:42,260
Yes.

33
00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:45,260
And of course these three all mean.

34
00:01:45,330 --> 00:01:46,100
Yes.

35
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:48,730
And they mean you're welcome.

36
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:49,470
Thank you very much.

37
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:50,130
Of course.

38
00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:50,450
Sure.

39
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:51,080
Yeah.

40
00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:52,900
No worries no worries.

41
00:01:52,900 --> 00:02:00,480
Again this is one that is usually informal informal and when you're helping out a good friend they say

42
00:02:00,510 --> 00:02:01,850
Oh thanks man.

43
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:03,120
Aw thanks a lot.

44
00:02:03,150 --> 00:02:04,740
And no worries no worries.

45
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:07,940
Thanks for helping me move my sofa today.

46
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:09,780
I know that it was inconvenient.

47
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:10,470
No worries.

48
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:11,520
Don't worry about it.

49
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:14,210
Sometimes people will say don't worry about it.

50
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:15,370
That's this one down here.

51
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:16,080
OK.

52
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:20,540
Sometimes if it's very quick and you're not even paying attention.

53
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:24,210
Oh hey thanks by the way thanks for sending out that email for me.

54
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:25,230
Huh huh.

55
00:02:25,230 --> 00:02:26,150
No problem.

56
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:32,400
That's a very quick one and you would use it only when maybe you're in a rush or you're focused on something

57
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:33,050
else.

58
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:33,260
OK.

59
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:38,010
Now the more formal ones a little bit more formal obviously you're welcome.

60
00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:39,210
Happy to help.

61
00:02:39,210 --> 00:02:44,370
This is something that somebody may be in customer service might say Oh happy to help.

62
00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:51,030
Happy to help or if maybe I help one of my students and my student says thank you for helping me correct

63
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:51,600
this.

64
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:53,790
I might say Happy to help.

65
00:02:53,790 --> 00:02:54,870
Happy to help.

66
00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:56,880
I won't say Happy to help.

67
00:02:56,880 --> 00:03:01,000
I'll say happy to happy to happy to help.

68
00:03:01,130 --> 00:03:06,990
OK this one I think is very formal and I don't use it very often.

69
00:03:06,990 --> 00:03:08,100
My pleasure.

70
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:09,100
My pleasure.

71
00:03:09,210 --> 00:03:11,860
In customer service you do hear it.

72
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:13,350
So if you call somebody.

73
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:14,540
My computer's broken.

74
00:03:14,550 --> 00:03:20,670
And then they help you fix your computer or whatever and then you say Oh thank you so much for helping

75
00:03:20,670 --> 00:03:21,140
me.

76
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,840
It might say that's my pleasure.

77
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:24,210
It's my pleasure.

78
00:03:24,210 --> 00:03:29,170
I use it once in a while but it's pretty formal so I don't use it that much.

79
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:29,490
OK.

80
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:30,560
No sweat.

81
00:03:30,570 --> 00:03:39,150
This one this one sometimes is used in customer service but it could also go up here in the ones that

82
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:40,980
are not so formal.

83
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:46,340
These two are similar to no sweat but can be used in many different situations.

84
00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:50,310
Not at all and no big deal no big deal.

85
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:54,030
Again thank you so much for helping me do my homework yesterday.

86
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:56,340
No big deal no big deal.

87
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,960
Not at all not at all.

88
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:59,490
Don't worry about it.

89
00:03:59,490 --> 00:04:00,370
Same thing.

90
00:04:00,390 --> 00:04:00,600
OK.

91
00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:07,740
So these are all really really common and they can be used in lots of different situations and sometimes

92
00:04:07,770 --> 00:04:09,600
forget it forget it forget it.

93
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:12,110
That means you don't even need to talk about it.

94
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:13,200
Forget it.

95
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:13,880
Forget it.

96
00:04:13,910 --> 00:04:14,150
Right.

97
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:19,020
So those are some of the different ways that we can say you're welcome in different situations.

98
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:25,230
You've got to listen out for where they're used and how they're used because again sometimes they're

99
00:04:25,230 --> 00:04:27,990
used formally and sometimes not formally.

100
00:04:27,990 --> 00:04:30,760
You really have to pay attention to the situation.

101
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:36,050
They're used in but hopefully now you know more ways that you can say you're welcome.

102
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:42,810
So to practice this what you can do is go on to the Internet maybe go to Craigslist or Zillow or any

103
00:04:42,810 --> 00:04:49,910
other site and find an English apartment listing or English apartment post something that you're maybe

104
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:58,700
interested in and read it and then do a phone call a role play record yourself between both people the

105
00:04:58,710 --> 00:05:03,860
landlord yourself and if you can get a friend involved if you can get a friend to do it with you.

106
00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:04,650
That's great.

107
00:05:04,650 --> 00:05:05,750
You can do it together.

108
00:05:05,850 --> 00:05:08,370
Could be really fun do it several different times.

109
00:05:08,370 --> 00:05:14,160
Make sure to record it so that you can listen to it again and pick out where you might actually improve

110
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:16,440
things that you said that might be strange.

111
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:22,680
Make sure to try to use some of the words and phrases that we talked about in this lesson.

112
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:23,550
All right good luck.
