1
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:11,160
In the last lesson we talked about how to compare things which is very important if you want to describe

2
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:14,250
the difference between that and that.

3
00:00:14,310 --> 00:00:19,560
Maybe you're making a recommendation or maybe you're talking about a past experience.

4
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:26,910
In this lesson we're going to talk about inquiry how to make an inquiry or sometimes it's pronounced

5
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:29,380
inquiry basically inquiry.

6
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:36,420
An inquiry means asking someone who knows something a question so that you can get information about

7
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:37,250
what they know.

8
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:39,560
That's what it means when we do that.

9
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:47,080
We say we are inquiring so we're making an inquiry or an inquiry or we are inquiring.

10
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:50,730
We can sometimes say I would like to inquire about.

11
00:00:50,740 --> 00:00:56,640
OK so in this lesson we're going to be talking about a couple of key words and phrases at the start.

12
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:00,670
Then we're going to go into a real life situation.

13
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:05,730
We're going to talk about an apartment situation if you want to rent an apartment.

14
00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:10,490
You may need to call the landlord to get information about the apartment.

15
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:16,740
So we're going to do that situation so that we can go over how to use some of these words and phrases

16
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:22,080
and then we'll look at a couple of different ways to say you're welcome in English as well as talk a

17
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:24,720
little bit about how to bargain.

18
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:27,470
Just some simple ways to talk about price.

19
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:34,100
To negotiate a little bit negotiate means we maybe don't like the price something is a little too much.

20
00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:37,540
How can we push a little bit to get a lower price.

21
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:43,500
So we'll talk about a lot of things in this lesson and right now we'll start with vocabulary and phrases.
