1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:02,210
So we're looking for this apartment.

2
00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:09,150
We see the post we call the phone number within the listing within the post and somebody picks up and

3
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:10,050
says hello.

4
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:13,510
Well the first thing you need to do is confirm that this is the right person.

5
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:13,920
Right.

6
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:23,310
So you might start by saying yes is is this the owner of.

7
00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:26,460
Is this the owner of the or is this the landlord.

8
00:00:26,470 --> 00:00:31,080
You could also say landlord of the apartment in Greenpoint.

9
00:00:31,110 --> 00:00:32,970
That's listed on Zillow.

10
00:00:32,970 --> 00:00:33,810
Dot com.

11
00:00:33,810 --> 00:00:36,620
Or you could say I'm calling about the.

12
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:38,420
And then you can say what you're calling about.

13
00:00:38,490 --> 00:00:43,140
I'm calling about the one bedroom apartment in Greenpoint.

14
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:44,520
That's on Zillow dot com.

15
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:45,870
Is this the.

16
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:46,910
Is this the owner.

17
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:48,040
Is this the landlord.

18
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:52,470
You could say the newly renovated one bedroom Greenpoint apartment.

19
00:00:52,470 --> 00:00:52,730
Hello.

20
00:00:52,740 --> 00:00:57,930
I'm calling about the renovated one bedroom apartment in Greenpoint.

21
00:00:57,930 --> 00:01:01,460
That's posted on Zillow dot com.

22
00:01:01,470 --> 00:01:04,590
Is this the owner not Are you the owner.

23
00:01:04,710 --> 00:01:08,070
If we're on the phone we should say is this the owner.

24
00:01:08,090 --> 00:01:10,620
OK this is when you say your own name.

25
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:12,830
And is this when you're on the phone.

26
00:01:12,830 --> 00:01:14,400
This is how we say it basically.

27
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:18,050
We usually don't say I am I am OK.

28
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:20,370
Yes this is the owner.

29
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:20,690
Yes.

30
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:21,620
This is the owner.

31
00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:23,070
OK great.

32
00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:25,990
Well I'm just wondering first.

33
00:01:26,090 --> 00:01:27,910
That's the first thing I want to say.

34
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:33,820
If the apartment is still available because I'm very interested in taking a look at it.

35
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:40,920
If so if we use if so when we want to say if this thing is true.

36
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:42,120
Right.

37
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:43,380
You look tired.

38
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:44,450
Are you tired.

39
00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:53,790
If so you should take a nap if so if you're tired it's a way to say if this thing is true and it's pretty

40
00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:58,550
common actually now it's important not to say I really really really want to live here.

41
00:01:58,620 --> 00:02:05,440
I want to rent this apartment because then later you can't talk about the price probably.

42
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:09,260
Maybe it will be harder for you to negotiate.

43
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:15,840
Which means to get maybe get a better price so it's better to just say that you're interested in the

44
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:16,530
apartment.

45
00:02:16,610 --> 00:02:17,310
OK great.

46
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:23,190
I'm just wondering if just wondering if the apartment is still available because I'm very interested

47
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:24,750
in taking a look.

48
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:27,630
If so we're taking a look at it.

49
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:33,150
If so a few people have come by for showings but it's still available.

50
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:37,880
So if somebody comes by that means you go to a place for a short time.

51
00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:44,970
My friend came by yesterday and we talked for an hour or I'm going to stop by the bookstore for a few

52
00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:46,500
minutes before I go home.

53
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:54,390
We often use come by stopped by and we talk about going to a place usually for a short period of time

54
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:55,870
for showings showings.

55
00:02:55,920 --> 00:03:02,430
It's when you actually show an apartment to somebody who might live there but it's still available.

56
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:09,020
So people saw it but they haven't yet decided to rent the place.

57
00:03:09,350 --> 00:03:11,830
OK so maybe that gives me a feeling of pressure.

58
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:13,510
Maybe I need to hurry up a little bit.

59
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:14,910
OK that's great.

60
00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:16,240
That means it's still available.

61
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:22,380
So the first thing you should do when you call is make sure that from the time that you saw or the time

62
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:29,910
that the listing was posted and the time you're calling from that time to this time nobody has actually

63
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:31,260
rented the apartment.

64
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:33,820
You need to make sure about that first.

65
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,540
Usually that's the first thing.

66
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:39,190
Then you can get into some of the details.

67
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,280
OK that's great.

68
00:03:40,290 --> 00:03:42,860
Do you think I could ask a few questions.

69
00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:44,950
Could I ask a few questions.

70
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:47,540
I'd like to ask a few questions.

71
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:52,000
Do you think I could ask a few questions is really really polite.

72
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:53,790
Maybe it's too polite.

73
00:03:53,790 --> 00:03:55,790
Maybe it's very polite.

74
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:56,940
You can also.

75
00:03:56,940 --> 00:04:04,950
It's just fine to say I'd like to ask a few questions or can I ask a couple questions.

76
00:04:04,950 --> 00:04:12,540
I'd like to to ask a few questions then they might say go ahead go ahead go ahead.

77
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:13,970
That means please do.

78
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:14,820
Please do.

79
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:18,660
If we ask a question do you think I could ask a few questions.

80
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:19,740
Yeah absolutely.

81
00:04:19,740 --> 00:04:20,190
Or maybe.

82
00:04:20,190 --> 00:04:20,960
Sure.

83
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:21,470
Or.

84
00:04:21,460 --> 00:04:22,360
Okay.

85
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:25,320
And then that means you need to say what your questions are.

86
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:28,320
Well I'd like to know more about the neighborhood.

87
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:33,860
I'd like to know more about the neighborhood and also whether or not pets are allowed.

88
00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:34,780
I have a cat.

89
00:04:34,830 --> 00:04:41,340
Now notice this is not a question really but it kind of is a question even though it's not said as a

90
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:45,870
question because you are making an inquiry or an inquiry.

91
00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:47,440
You're getting more information.

92
00:04:47,490 --> 00:04:51,320
We could easily say this as a question do you think you could tell me.

93
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:56,470
Or could you tell me if the neighborhood is safe or not.

94
00:04:56,490 --> 00:05:00,150
Or could you tell me a little bit about the neighborhood.

95
00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:04,000
And also do you allow cats in the apartment.

96
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:08,400
Are are cats allowed our cats allowed.

97
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:09,360
I have one.

98
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:17,580
I have one so it's still kind of a question even though it isn't really a question because it doesn't

99
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:22,240
have a question mark but we could very easily ask this as a question.

100
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:27,780
We would just use some of the phrases that we learned at the very beginning of this lesson.

101
00:05:27,810 --> 00:05:30,780
So now we have our answer from the landlord.

102
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:32,610
As for the neighborhood.

103
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:37,670
As for the neighborhood when we use as for something as for you.

104
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:43,800
Well as for the report you wrote yesterday means this is the topic I'm going to talk about.

105
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:46,400
As for the neighborhood it's relatively quiet.

106
00:05:46,530 --> 00:05:47,690
It's pretty quiet.

107
00:05:48,090 --> 00:05:49,010
It's pretty quiet.

108
00:05:49,230 --> 00:05:56,100
It's it's kind of quiet ok which is a good thing usually but there are a lot of great places to eat

109
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:56,880
nearby.

110
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:58,760
Why would the landlord say.

111
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:01,200
But he could say and I guess.

112
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:05,280
But maybe that landlord is thinking a quiet place.

113
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:10,400
Maybe suggests that it's not very interesting and there aren't a lot of things to do.

114
00:06:10,410 --> 00:06:16,810
I'm saying it's quiet it's peaceful and at the same time there are lots of things to do.

115
00:06:16,830 --> 00:06:21,990
Lots of places to eat but there are lots of great places to eat nearby.

116
00:06:21,990 --> 00:06:29,040
The school is within walking distance walking distance is kind of a subjective word that means maybe

117
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:35,520
different people have a different idea about what that means but we can say it's probably less than

118
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:36,570
10 minutes.

119
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:43,140
And the subway is just a five minute walk away a five minute walk here.

120
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:54,580
It's quite interesting we can make our own adjectives a five minute walk thirty two page book The short

121
00:06:54,580 --> 00:07:06,000
book a three hour bus ride a 15 year old maybe a 15 year old movie.

122
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:14,350
OK so we can make our own adjectives by adding a hyphen ups a hyphen hyphen is this one that goes between

123
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:15,770
the number and the noun.

124
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:18,850
Take away the S and then it makes an adjective.

125
00:07:19,420 --> 00:07:22,000
So it's a five minute walk away.

126
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:27,280
Albert Park is a made up park name is right across the street right.

127
00:07:27,340 --> 00:07:33,160
Gives us a feeling of it being very close right across the street doesn't mean this right doesn't mean

128
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:33,780
that right.

129
00:07:33,790 --> 00:07:35,230
It just means directly.

130
00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:39,040
So it's a great location and totally safe.

131
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:42,430
Oh so I've just remembered your other question.

132
00:07:42,430 --> 00:07:45,680
Your other thing was about if your cat is allowed right.

133
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:51,910
Oh and cats are allowed but no big dogs no big dogs no big dogs allowed.

134
00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:54,470
So when you remember something you go Oh yeah.

135
00:07:54,490 --> 00:07:56,230
And about cats.

136
00:07:56,230 --> 00:07:57,420
As for cats.

137
00:07:57,430 --> 00:08:02,290
As for your cat we use as for when we want to mention a topic.

138
00:08:02,290 --> 00:08:09,460
So the landlord has answered my initial inquiries about whether or not the apartment is available.

139
00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:14,380
About whether or not I can bring my cats and about the neighborhood.

140
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:19,040
The landlord has told me about how nice the neighborhood is.

141
00:08:19,210 --> 00:08:24,950
But I still have a few more things I'd like to know once we get into the conversation a little bit.

142
00:08:25,030 --> 00:08:28,510
Then we can start using more direct language.

143
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:34,930
If you use too many of the polite phrases that we learned at the beginning of the lesson then sometimes

144
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:38,020
the conversation won't flow so it's okay.

145
00:08:38,020 --> 00:08:42,220
Once you get into it to start using some more direct questions.

146
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:47,670
Now I'm going to get a little bit more information and we're gonna start talking about the rent and

147
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:52,570
when we talk about the rent we need to do a little bit of negotiation.

148
00:08:52,570 --> 00:08:56,700
So to negotiate means to discuss price.

149
00:08:56,710 --> 00:09:02,980
Often you can negotiate about lots of different things but often in America when you negotiate you need

150
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:08,280
to give up something so that you can get something you need to make an offer.

151
00:09:08,290 --> 00:09:09,720
You need to make an offer.

152
00:09:09,730 --> 00:09:14,160
Rarely in America do people just say can you give me a lower price.

153
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:15,850
Can you please give me a discount.

154
00:09:15,850 --> 00:09:16,960
There has to be a reason.

155
00:09:17,050 --> 00:09:18,430
So we'll look at that.

156
00:09:18,430 --> 00:09:21,960
We'll look at that in the rest of this inquiry situation.

157
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:22,820
That's great.

158
00:09:22,930 --> 00:09:23,770
That's great.

159
00:09:23,890 --> 00:09:26,560
Thank you for the information and about the rent.

160
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:30,010
So now I'm changing topics to talk about.

161
00:09:30,010 --> 00:09:32,200
Talk about money how much I will need to pay.

162
00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:33,010
OK.

163
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:41,110
Are the utilities included are the utilities included so utilities are the things you need to pay that

164
00:09:41,110 --> 00:09:49,330
your apartment runs on so electricity may maybe gas water Internet.

165
00:09:49,330 --> 00:09:55,840
These things are utilities if they're included that means you don't need to pay any extra if the rent

166
00:09:55,840 --> 00:10:00,070
is one thousand five hundred dollars or fifteen hundred dollars.

167
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:03,630
I don't need to pay more than one thousand five hundred.

168
00:10:03,730 --> 00:10:05,500
They're part of that.

169
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:08,200
Heating and water are included.

170
00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:09,250
This is pretty common.

171
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:14,350
Heating and water are included but electricity and Wi-Fi are not.

172
00:10:14,350 --> 00:10:20,030
So that means you don't need to worry about heating and water but you do need to pay for the electricity.

173
00:10:20,170 --> 00:10:25,520
Depending on how much you use and of course Wi-Fi you would have to pay for those yourself.

174
00:10:25,690 --> 00:10:26,090
OK.

175
00:10:26,110 --> 00:10:26,890
No problem.

176
00:10:26,890 --> 00:10:35,070
Now we get into the negotiation one thousand five hundred is a little over my budget over my budget.

177
00:10:35,210 --> 00:10:43,180
OK over my budget means it's more than I really want to to spend it's more than I planned to spend.

178
00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:53,080
We can also say out of my price range that out of my price range a bit over my budget.

179
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:55,710
OK so we're sort of expressing a bit of pain.

180
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:58,750
This is common in an English negotiation.

181
00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:01,810
First you say oh I don't know I can't.

182
00:11:01,810 --> 00:11:03,880
And then OK.

183
00:11:03,970 --> 00:11:07,750
And it looks a little high for the area as well.

184
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:13,660
So that means in this neighborhood maybe I saw some other apartments that were cheaper or maybe I saw

185
00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:17,010
one that was a little bigger and it was the same price.

186
00:11:17,050 --> 00:11:18,640
I think it's too expensive.

187
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:23,360
This high means too expensive a little high for the area as well.

188
00:11:23,410 --> 00:11:29,830
So I'm sort of trying to get to some point I'm trying to say can you give me a lower rent but I don't

189
00:11:29,830 --> 00:11:33,230
want to just say can you give me a lower rent.

190
00:11:33,580 --> 00:11:43,660
Would you consider one thousand three hundred if I sign a two year lease so a lease is a rental contract

191
00:11:44,050 --> 00:11:45,880
when you rent an apartment.

192
00:11:45,910 --> 00:11:49,610
We call it off in America we call it a lease.

193
00:11:50,030 --> 00:11:56,740
We say Would you consider when we want to offer something when we want to offer maybe what we will do.

194
00:11:56,780 --> 00:12:00,140
And we are suggesting that we pay a little bit less.

195
00:12:00,140 --> 00:12:06,080
Would you consider thirteen hundred if I sign a two year lease if I signed a two year lease.

196
00:12:06,290 --> 00:12:11,680
Then you don't have to worry about finding another person to live in this apartment.

197
00:12:11,690 --> 00:12:17,080
Another tenant tenant is a person who lives in usually in an apartment.

198
00:12:17,090 --> 00:12:24,640
My tenants my tenants the people who live in my in the houses I own or the apartments I own.

199
00:12:24,650 --> 00:12:26,620
So would you consider it's really common.

200
00:12:26,690 --> 00:12:30,110
But the landlord doesn't really want to talk about it on the phone.

201
00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:35,900
The landlord wants to show the apartment first and then talk about price stuff.

202
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:39,690
We could talk about that once you've come by for a look.

203
00:12:39,770 --> 00:12:43,030
We could talk about that once you've come by for a look.

204
00:12:43,070 --> 00:12:47,020
So the landlord is putting it off put it off.

205
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:50,590
That means to push that back for for a later discussion.

206
00:12:50,650 --> 00:12:54,870
Maybe I might be willing to be flexible on that.

207
00:12:54,890 --> 00:12:58,470
I might be willing to be flexible on that.

208
00:12:58,490 --> 00:13:05,840
I know that sounds a little bit weird but flexible means that my my position on something or what I

209
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:08,690
think about something might change a little bit.

210
00:13:08,690 --> 00:13:11,000
We can negotiate more.

211
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:17,600
I'm really trying to get you to come to look at the place to look at the apartment and then we can negotiate

212
00:13:17,660 --> 00:13:18,830
about the rent.

213
00:13:18,830 --> 00:13:20,620
About the the price right.

214
00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:23,960
So I'm okay with the idea of talking about it later.

215
00:13:23,990 --> 00:13:26,410
When do you think I could stop by.

216
00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:28,160
When do you think I could stop by.

217
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:29,670
And this is pretty polite.

218
00:13:29,690 --> 00:13:32,040
When do you think I could stop by.

219
00:13:32,150 --> 00:13:33,910
Would tomorrow afternoon work.

220
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:37,900
Remember from our class our lesson about inviting.

221
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,750
We use work in this way to suggest a time.

222
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:43,390
Does that time work for you.

223
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:46,130
Would tomorrow afternoon work for you.

224
00:13:46,130 --> 00:13:46,670
Yeah.

225
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:48,460
Yeah that would be perfect.

226
00:13:48,470 --> 00:13:51,440
That would be perfect would be perfect.

227
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:57,220
3 pm now you could say is 3 p.m. okay.

228
00:13:57,290 --> 00:14:05,630
Is 3 p.m. OK but to make it shorter sometimes we'll just say 3 p.m. 3 p.m. or 5 p.m. 4 p.m. whatever.

229
00:14:05,630 --> 00:14:06,820
Great right.

230
00:14:06,830 --> 00:14:13,200
Could you text me the address text here is a verb that means give me exactly where I need to go.

231
00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:15,990
Send it to me in a message to this number maybe.

232
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:17,490
Could you text me the address.

233
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:18,780
Yes.

234
00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:20,260
See you tomorrow.

235
00:14:20,270 --> 00:14:20,770
Yes.

236
00:14:20,780 --> 00:14:21,860
See you tomorrow.

237
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:25,520
So this is a very common very normal situation.

238
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:27,910
This kind of thing happens all the time.

239
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:32,160
And if you find yourself in a situation where you need to ask for information.

240
00:14:32,270 --> 00:14:39,020
Remember start with some of the phrases that we learned early on at the beginning of the lesson and

241
00:14:39,020 --> 00:14:45,800
then once you get into the discussion into the conversation don't worry too much about using them.

242
00:14:45,830 --> 00:14:49,730
You can ask direct questions like are the blah blah blah blah blah.

243
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:51,750
Does the apartment have furniture.

244
00:14:51,770 --> 00:14:55,940
Does the electricity work it's OK to use those questions.

245
00:14:55,940 --> 00:15:03,950
Once you get in it and then maybe when you're going to say goodbye then you can start using some more

246
00:15:03,950 --> 00:15:09,580
polite language again like when do you think I could stop by.

247
00:15:09,610 --> 00:15:09,820
Right.

248
00:15:09,830 --> 00:15:15,380
That's very polite very very respectful beginning an end pretty polite pretty respectful the middle

249
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:18,950
just go through the details and ask what you want to ask.
