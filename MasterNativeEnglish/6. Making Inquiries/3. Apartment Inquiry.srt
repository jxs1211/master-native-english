1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:06,420
So now let's try to use some of these phrases in a real situation and I'm going to try to make it as

2
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:08,160
realistic as possible.

3
00:00:08,310 --> 00:00:15,330
Let's say for example you move to America OK or let's say you already live here and you want to move

4
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:16,910
to another place.

5
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:21,570
I use America because I'm American so I know kind of how it works.

6
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:23,310
I've had many apartments before.

7
00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:30,730
An apartment is a place people live in a larger building usually it's not a stand alone building a standalone

8
00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:35,520
building is probably called a house and maybe only one family lives there.

9
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:40,350
An apartment is usually in a larger building and it's usually smaller.

10
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:48,870
OK so we're gonna do an apartment inquiry or inquiry and we're gonna be calling the landlord can also

11
00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:50,700
say landlady.

12
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:52,900
Now this is the owner of the apartment.

13
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:54,320
The owner of the apartment.

14
00:00:54,450 --> 00:01:00,360
If it's not the owner then it's probably a broker or agent in America.

15
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:06,540
And for example in New York an agent will take a fee and I guess that's probably true anywhere in the

16
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:07,260
world.

17
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:13,890
So if you go through an agent you probably need to pay more if you can call the landlord or landlady

18
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:20,270
or owner directly that's usually better in this situation we're going to actually call the WE'RE GONNA

19
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:26,040
GET THE NUMBER OF THE LANDLORD AND WE'RE GONNA CALL and we're gonna get some information because we're

20
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:27,990
interested in the apartment.

21
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:32,530
Now there are many ways to find an apartment in America.

22
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:39,930
There are a lot of Web sites you can you can of course go to an agency you can look in the maybe the

23
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:46,520
newspaper but there are some popular web web sites that you can use like Craigslist dot com.

24
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:51,150
And there are some other ones like Zillow dot com.

25
00:01:51,150 --> 00:01:58,670
And who knows maybe when you're watching this it's 50 years from now for when this is being filmed and

26
00:01:59,010 --> 00:02:06,900
there's a completely different way of doing this but we use generally a Web site then we'll find a a

27
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:13,140
listing find a listing listing is basically a post that someone has put up on one of these Web sites

28
00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:18,360
and we usually search based on some certain criteria.

29
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:19,580
We have some criteria.

30
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:21,020
This is what we're searching.

31
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:30,210
Maybe I'm looking for a one bedroom and this is often abbreviated as B R one bedroom one bathroom.

32
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:36,540
So if you see one B are one B R that means one bedroom one bathroom bedroom is usually first.

33
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:44,100
So if you see to be are one bra that means two bedrooms one bathroom if you see to be are too bizarre

34
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:47,890
it means two bedrooms two bathrooms you get the idea.

35
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:53,690
You'll also often see how many square feet in America we usually use feet feet to measure.

36
00:02:53,700 --> 00:03:00,000
So it'll say often F T R S Q F T like that square feet square feet.

37
00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:04,080
If you're in another country then maybe it's square meter square meter.

38
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:04,340
Right.

39
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:10,840
And then of course you'll see the asking price asking price or the price per month the rent.

40
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:17,220
We often call this just the rent and let's say it's 1000 let's say we're looking for something that's

41
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:19,280
one thousand five hundred dollars.

42
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:21,280
OK one thousand five hundred dollars.

43
00:03:21,330 --> 00:03:26,130
The poster or the listing will also have probably the neighborhood.

44
00:03:26,130 --> 00:03:28,260
So let's say it's in Brooklyn.

45
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:30,130
Brooklyn isn't a neighborhood.

46
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:32,580
Brooklyn is a burrow in New York.

47
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:35,440
Let's say the neighborhood is Greenpoint.

48
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:36,400
OK.

49
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:38,160
So we see a post we see a listing.

50
00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:48,120
It says one bedroom one B R one B R and it's a one bedroom one bathroom it's in Greenpoint.

51
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:53,430
And the rent is one thousand five hundred which maybe is too expensive.

52
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:54,810
We think it's too much.

53
00:03:54,870 --> 00:03:56,380
Actually that's pretty cheap.

54
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,830
One thousand five hundred for Greenpoint.

55
00:03:58,830 --> 00:04:03,210
That's pretty cheap and maybe there are some extra details here.

56
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:07,140
Let's say it says its newly renovated.

57
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:14,600
That means there was some old things and those things were taken out and maybe there's a new kitchen.

58
00:04:14,610 --> 00:04:23,430
They completely redid the apartment and maybe it also says it's fully furnished now furnished or unfurnished

59
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:27,090
furnished means that there's a sofa there's a bed.

60
00:04:27,090 --> 00:04:34,080
All of that stuff is already there unfurnished means there's nothing except for appliances appliances

61
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:43,520
are maybe the microwave the sometimes the TV dishwasher the oven perhaps these are air conditioning.

62
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:50,100
These are appliances furnishings are bed sofa tables chairs that sort of thing.

63
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:55,970
So let's say it's fairly full before it's fully furnished and newly renovated.

64
00:04:55,980 --> 00:04:59,190
And these are the other details here and there's a phone number.

65
00:04:59,190 --> 00:05:04,010
Hey so we're gonna call the phone number and we're going to talk directly to the land lord.
