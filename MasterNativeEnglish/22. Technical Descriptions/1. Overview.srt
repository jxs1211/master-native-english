1
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:12,270
In the last lesson we talked about expressions we can use for tough situations like negotiations tough

2
00:00:12,270 --> 00:00:14,630
decisions and compromises.

3
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:20,610
In this lesson we're going to focus on technical language that means we're going to talk about how we

4
00:00:20,610 --> 00:00:23,790
can order things for example days in the month.

5
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:26,330
We're going to talk about math problems.

6
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:32,970
Now it's not anything very very complicated but we need to be able to say that sort of technical language

7
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:34,950
that sort of technical English.

8
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:40,530
We're going to talk about dates we're going to talk a little bit about addresses symbols things like

9
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:44,420
that that you need to be able to say naturally without thinking.

10
00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:48,450
In order to express basic things so that people can understand.

11
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:54,360
For example when you need to do something exactly where you need to go exactly how much of something

12
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:55,850
you have or you need.

13
00:00:55,890 --> 00:01:00,590
This is a basic stuff but it's necessary to know it.

14
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:02,830
And it can be a little bit complicated.

15
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,200
So let's get started.

16
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:05,640
We're going to start with order.

17
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:12,080
We're going to start with the really easy stuff and then we'll slowly get a little bit more complicated.

18
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:12,630
Let's begin.
