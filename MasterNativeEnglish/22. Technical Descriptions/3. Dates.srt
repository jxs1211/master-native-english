1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:06,390
Now that we've focused on the order of things and how we use those numbers in sequence we can now talk

2
00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:10,360
about dates and dates are actually written many different ways.

3
00:00:10,470 --> 00:00:14,890
But the standard format for America OK.

4
00:00:14,970 --> 00:00:18,800
So I'm an American teacher I can teach you the standard format in the US.

5
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:26,160
You'll often see on an internet forum you'll see m m d d y y y y like that.

6
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:32,300
So month day year you're at the full year and only the for the month.

7
00:00:32,310 --> 00:00:37,950
You write two numbers and for the day you write two numbers like that in that order.

8
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:43,700
So what would this be if we were going to write it before we say it let's write it.

9
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:48,480
Well m m would be 0 7 0 7.

10
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:54,710
D D would be 15 and Y Y Y would be two thousand seventeen.

11
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:56,930
Can we say 2017.

12
00:00:56,940 --> 00:00:57,510
Yes.

13
00:00:57,540 --> 00:01:05,850
So four years if it's well we'll talk about these years but if it's in this century the century we're

14
00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:14,520
in we say for example this one we say two thousand seventeen two thousand.

15
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:18,550
We also say twenty seventeen.

16
00:01:18,790 --> 00:01:19,760
2017.

17
00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:21,120
2017.

18
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:29,150
Now that's usually only four teens back when it was for example this most people would say two thousand

19
00:01:29,150 --> 00:01:31,920
five instead of 20 0 5.

20
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:34,020
You could say 20 0 5.

21
00:01:34,050 --> 00:01:39,300
But most people will say 2005 2001 2009.

22
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:41,530
You don't have to put end in there either.

23
00:01:41,550 --> 00:01:42,440
You don't have to.

24
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:42,990
OK.

25
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:49,830
And we'll talk about then this as well and this so that it's comfortable to say years even if it's a

26
00:01:49,830 --> 00:01:50,850
long time ago.

27
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:54,560
Now this one would be August August.

28
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:57,960
This is the abbreviation for August a Yuji.

29
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:03,980
If we want to write it out and then even though we don't have the R D here usually when we say it will

30
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:12,860
imagine there is an R D here so we'll say August 3rd 1773 1773.

31
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:17,500
So it's like saying 2017 1773.

32
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:21,860
We would not say one thousand seven hundred seventy three.

33
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:24,650
No we would not say usually.

34
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:27,080
Seventeen hundred seventy three.

35
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,070
Usually not.

36
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:28,410
Yeah.

37
00:02:28,410 --> 00:02:30,620
Could you could but usually not.

38
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:32,040
We can say it here.

39
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:33,580
If it's an even one.

40
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:35,130
But otherwise we don't.

41
00:02:35,130 --> 00:02:43,370
So for example this one would be DC which is the abbreviation of December December.

42
00:02:43,410 --> 00:02:49,890
This one we imagine a little s t here because there's a one December thirty first and then for this

43
00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:59,490
we say we say let me make a little space down here we say nineteen hundred nineteen hundred eighteen

44
00:02:59,490 --> 00:03:02,820
hundred seventeen hundred sixteen hundred.

45
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:17,990
If it's this though 1 9 0 2 then we would say 19 0 2 19 0 2 we would use 0 0 2 19 0 2 19 0 3 1913.

46
00:03:18,010 --> 00:03:20,580
OK so December 30 first nineteen hundred.

47
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:30,330
August 3rd 1773 July 15th 2017 and again if we were going to write this how would we write it in America

48
00:03:30,390 --> 00:03:40,800
we would write m m twelve D D thirty one y y y y nineteen hundred and 1 9 0 0.

49
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:47,060
That's how we'd write it but because it's long ago in history it will probably be written this way it

50
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:52,230
probably will be written like that if you read it in a book it's probably written like this because

51
00:03:52,230 --> 00:03:54,720
it's something that happened a long time ago.

52
00:03:54,810 --> 00:04:02,400
We usually write today's date on a Doctors form or something like that we'll write that in this format

53
00:04:02,460 --> 00:04:10,350
or if we're filling out a filling out a form filling out a form or an application perhaps an application

54
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:15,450
online then we'll use this format usually and not every country is the same.

55
00:04:15,570 --> 00:04:22,500
And sometimes you will see it written in other ways you might see sometimes you might actually see the

56
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:33,480
R D there you may you may sometimes you'll see three August 1773 sometimes with no comma that's there

57
00:04:33,510 --> 00:04:37,710
sometimes not in America usually you'll see d d m m y y y.

58
00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:42,420
Different countries are different and there are a lot of different ways to do it but I'm trying to give

59
00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:45,600
you a feeling for how it's typically typically done.

60
00:04:45,630 --> 00:04:53,820
For example let's say the date is let's say it's 10 20 2 1 9 9 3.

61
00:04:53,850 --> 00:05:02,220
OK so how would we say that I want you to say that to yourself right now if you said Tobar twenty second

62
00:05:02,850 --> 00:05:05,250
nineteen ninety three.

63
00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:06,450
You are correct.

64
00:05:06,450 --> 00:05:09,290
October 10 twenty second.

65
00:05:09,420 --> 00:05:10,660
Add a little end either.

66
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:12,050
Nineteen ninety three.

67
00:05:12,090 --> 00:05:12,810
You're right.

68
00:05:12,810 --> 00:05:23,100
Now sometimes dates don't quite fit into the very simple category of one day.

69
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:28,160
But there's actually a a range a range of dates.

70
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:35,760
Now how would we say that if we have a if we have a range of dates that means it begins here and and

71
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:39,240
could be all the way over here or anything in between.

72
00:05:39,330 --> 00:05:40,560
Well what do you mean by that.

73
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:45,780
Well I'll give you an example of an American holiday called Thanksgiving.

74
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:47,870
It's a harvest celebration.

75
00:05:47,970 --> 00:05:53,380
We're celebrating our thankfulness to our family members that we have them around and our friends.

76
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:54,870
We eat a lot of food.

77
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:57,390
It's it's anyway it's an American celebration.

78
00:05:57,390 --> 00:06:00,480
It's the fourth Thursday in November.

79
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:01,710
That's when it's held.

80
00:06:01,810 --> 00:06:04,440
So that's not always on the same day is it.

81
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:08,930
Sometimes that might be the twenty sixth sometimes the 25th.

82
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:10,140
So how can we say that.

83
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:19,160
Well we could say Thanksgiving is on the fourth Thursday in November.

84
00:06:19,290 --> 00:06:21,450
The abbreviation of November is by the way.

85
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:22,650
And O V.

86
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:30,570
And the fourth Thursday in November and usually falls falls.

87
00:06:30,570 --> 00:06:30,980
Yes.

88
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:43,860
It's like it sort of landed there and usually falls between the twenty sixth and twenty eighth of the

89
00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:49,030
month usually falls between the twenty sixth and the twenty eighth of the month.

90
00:06:49,050 --> 00:06:50,070
What month.

91
00:06:50,070 --> 00:06:51,350
November November.

92
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:54,900
Because I already said November I shouldn't say November twice.

93
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:56,590
I can just say the month.

94
00:06:56,610 --> 00:06:59,340
So that's how you would say different years.

95
00:06:59,370 --> 00:07:06,120
That's how you say the months and the days on those years and how you often see them written and that

96
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:14,610
is how you describe a range when a certain date might be within a certain period of time.

97
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:15,800
So I hope that's clear.

98
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:19,050
Now let's move on and talk about symbols.

99
00:07:19,050 --> 00:07:20,820
We're going to talk about symbols next.
