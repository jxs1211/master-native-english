1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:03,050
In this lesson we've talked about order things in sequence.

2
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:06,550
We've talked about dates we've talked about symbols.

3
00:00:06,570 --> 00:00:08,530
Now let's talk about numbers.

4
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:14,070
Now I know this lesson might be not as interesting a little little boring compared to the other lessons

5
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:16,360
but it's very important basic stuff.

6
00:00:16,380 --> 00:00:23,610
Let's go through basically how we can say numbers will move pretty quickly so that it's not too hopefully

7
00:00:23,610 --> 00:00:24,740
not too dry.

8
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:31,740
One very very important thing to remember when it comes to numbers is all you have to do to say numbers

9
00:00:31,770 --> 00:00:40,410
clearly is group them in threes not including this decimal but the group them in threes and within each

10
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:45,770
group of three between commas you just say the number.

11
00:00:45,810 --> 00:00:50,970
So this would be I think you can probably guess one hundred and seven.

12
00:00:50,970 --> 00:00:56,790
This would be three hundred and forty nine and the best way to know how to say a very big number is

13
00:00:56,790 --> 00:00:58,910
to count commas.

14
00:00:58,950 --> 00:01:00,300
That's really all you have to do.

15
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:06,560
You need to know how to say the number between zero and nine hundred ninety nine.

16
00:01:06,620 --> 00:01:07,220
OK.

17
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:13,470
And you need to know how to count commas and you need to know what each of these commas means or what

18
00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:14,610
each of them represents.

19
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:18,270
This is thousand the first comma is thousand.

20
00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:20,350
The second one is million.

21
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:22,850
The third one is billion.

22
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:28,620
And if you really want to know the next one is trillion but you don't often need to say that.

23
00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:28,910
OK.

24
00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:35,630
So a thousand million billion if there are three commas you're going to say billion then million then

25
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:36,270
thousand.

26
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:39,840
If there are two commas you're going to say million and then thousand.

27
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:43,550
If there is only one comma then you're just going to say thousand.

28
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:43,970
OK.

29
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:48,090
That's all you need to know if there are no commas then you don't need to say any of them and you just

30
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:49,030
say either.

31
00:01:49,050 --> 00:01:54,630
Hundred or if it doesn't have one hundred then we don't even need to talk about that because you already

32
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:55,080
know.

33
00:01:55,090 --> 00:01:55,530
OK.

34
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:56,910
Count commas.

35
00:01:56,910 --> 00:01:59,080
The other thing you need to know is this.

36
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:04,400
You do not need to add and between every number that makes it much more complicated.

37
00:02:04,410 --> 00:02:05,670
You don't need to do that.

38
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:12,600
You usually only need to use and if there is a zero in front of the last number in front of the very

39
00:02:12,690 --> 00:02:13,710
end of the number.

40
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:17,100
That's the only time you usually need to use an OK.

41
00:02:17,130 --> 00:02:20,470
So for example this might be one hundred seven.

42
00:02:20,490 --> 00:02:26,510
You don't have to say and but you could say one hundred and seven one hundred and seven.

43
00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:32,240
This might be one thousand and seven in fact you should probably say one thousand and seven.

44
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:39,870
If you say one thousand seven it's OK it's OK but that's when you would usually use and otherwise don't

45
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:40,360
do it.

46
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:43,190
It just makes it harder and you have more to think about.

47
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:43,660
OK.

48
00:02:43,770 --> 00:02:49,140
The last thing that you need to know is after this show we say dot point.

49
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:54,000
Period after this point O P O I N T.

50
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:57,270
And we say point point after that.

51
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,430
Just say the number.

52
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:03,500
You don't need to think about hundreds thousands millions or anything just say the number directly.

53
00:03:03,630 --> 00:03:04,740
So let's go through these.

54
00:03:04,770 --> 00:03:05,110
OK.

55
00:03:05,130 --> 00:03:08,430
This one one hundred and seven one hundred and seven.

56
00:03:08,490 --> 00:03:12,380
This one one hundred seventy one hundred seventy.

57
00:03:12,450 --> 00:03:18,340
Next one one thousand and seven one thousand and seven.

58
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:23,310
OK one thousand seventy one thousand seventy.

59
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:27,120
You can say one thousand and seventy if you want to.

60
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:27,900
You don't have to.

61
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:28,700
OK.

62
00:03:28,710 --> 00:03:36,030
This one one thousand seven hundred one thousand seven hundred one thousand seven hundred and one one

63
00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:38,360
thousand seven hundred and one.

64
00:03:38,370 --> 00:03:38,650
OK.

65
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:39,750
Let's get a little bigger.

66
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:41,180
Seventeen thousand.

67
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:42,390
Because there's one comma.

68
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:45,730
Seventeen thousand five hundred eighty seven.

69
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:47,390
Don't need to use end at all.

70
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:50,470
Then we can say it more quickly seventeen thousand five hundred eighty seven.

71
00:03:50,490 --> 00:03:52,140
Seventeen thousand five hundred eighty seven.

72
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:55,200
You have to be able to say numbers very quickly.

73
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:57,360
Seventeen thousand five hundred eighty seven.

74
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:00,330
Seventeen thousand five hundred eighty seven should be very natural.

75
00:04:00,330 --> 00:04:01,360
Very easy immediate.

76
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:02,130
OK.

77
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:04,320
Numbers are getting bigger but it doesn't get harder.

78
00:04:04,350 --> 00:04:04,790
OK.

79
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:14,300
One hundred seven thousand one hundred and seven point 1 0 7 7 0 1.

80
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:14,950
Easy.

81
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:16,800
1 0 7 7 0 1.

82
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:19,690
Can we say 1 0 7 7 0 1.

83
00:04:19,770 --> 00:04:20,030
Yeah.

84
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:23,440
That's OK you can say that 1 0 7 7 0 1.

85
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:24,050
No problem.

86
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:24,650
OK.

87
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:28,920
Now we have one two three three commas.

88
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:31,290
So that means we need to say billion.

89
00:04:31,290 --> 00:04:32,990
Million and thousand.

90
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:33,260
OK.

91
00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:42,390
So let's try this very easy 1 billion one hundred seventy one million one hundred seventy thousand seven

92
00:04:42,390 --> 00:04:45,890
hundred and one point one three.

93
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:51,000
Very easy one billion one hundred seventy one billion one hundred seventy thousand seven hundred and

94
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,360
one point one three.

95
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:53,080
Very simple.

96
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:54,240
OK last one.

97
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:58,770
Well it looks so long so scary but it's actually not it's actually not.

98
00:04:58,770 --> 00:05:00,840
I realized that I've killed all the comments.

99
00:05:00,850 --> 00:05:02,480
But I can read it without.

100
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:03,580
And I think you can too.

101
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:11,800
All right three hundred forty nine billion two hundred thirty million four hundred sixty seven thousand

102
00:05:12,010 --> 00:05:18,880
three hundred and four point seven six five three hundred forty nine billion two hundred thirty million

103
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:24,070
four hundred sixty seven thousand three hundred and four point seventy six five practice that until

104
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:30,370
it's really easy go online just read an article and find some numbers big numbers small numbers and

105
00:05:30,370 --> 00:05:35,950
just practice saying them again and again follow the simple rules that we just talked about remember

106
00:05:35,950 --> 00:05:41,440
how many commas you see is the words that you need to say this this or this.

107
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:46,730
Remember that after the decimal you don't need to think about hundreds or thousands.

108
00:05:46,810 --> 00:05:52,550
And remember that usually we don't use and unless there is a zero in front of the last number.

109
00:05:52,630 --> 00:05:55,990
And if you remember those things you don't need to know anything else.

110
00:05:55,990 --> 00:06:00,850
The most important thing is that you get fast at this when it comes to numbers you shouldn't have to

111
00:06:00,850 --> 00:06:04,380
think for a long time about just how to say the number.

112
00:06:04,390 --> 00:06:05,880
It should be automatic.

113
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:09,130
Should come out of your mouth completely naturally.

114
00:06:09,130 --> 00:06:09,430
All right.

115
00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:12,580
So hopefully that's relatively easy.

116
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:18,300
Practice it until it's really smooth and you can speak and say numbers without thinking.

117
00:06:18,310 --> 00:06:21,850
Now we're going to quickly go on and talk about math.
