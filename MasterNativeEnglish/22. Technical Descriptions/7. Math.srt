1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:00,530
All right.

2
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:07,000
So we're getting close to the end of our lesson on technical descriptions technical English.

3
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:11,700
We're going to quickly talk about math or math equations.

4
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:13,410
Sometimes they're called equations.

5
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:16,110
Sometimes they're called problems.

6
00:00:16,110 --> 00:00:23,340
Math problems and we sometimes need to actually speak these out so let's just quickly go through this.

7
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:30,060
Well if we're doing this one we're doing addition if we're doing this one we're doing subtraction.

8
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:36,630
If we're doing this when we're doing division and if we're doing this when we're doing multiplication

9
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:38,850
we are multiplying.

10
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:43,700
If we're going to make these into verbs we're going to add seven and seven.

11
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:49,620
We're going to subtract add it's the verb going to divide.

12
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:58,350
We're going to multiply and these words these verbs divide multiply subtract and add these words are

13
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:01,260
very common outside of math equations.

14
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:08,150
So if you know these these words then you start to notice them spoken in lots of other situations.

15
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:12,810
Well we should we should work hard so that we can multiply our success.

16
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:14,360
We need to divide.

17
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:17,030
We need to divide the land divide the area.

18
00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:18,060
Whatever.

19
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:25,760
OK could you please subtract my salary could you please subtract my salary.

20
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:28,360
I'd like you to add cucumbers.

21
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:30,920
I'd like you to add cucumbers or extra cheese.

22
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:36,710
So these verbs are very very common outside of math equations.

23
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:37,060
OK.

24
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:44,180
Just to be very clear when we're actually saying these math problems though we use the prepositions.

25
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:46,020
So let's do it.

26
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:51,090
Seven plus seven equals or is.

27
00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:56,730
So sometimes we say equals and sometimes we say is an either one is OK seven plus seven is 14.

28
00:01:56,790 --> 00:01:59,550
Seven plus seven equals 14.

29
00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:00,160
OK.

30
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:06,710
Seven minus seven equals zero seven minus seven is zero.

31
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:16,620
Seven divided by seven divided by seven is one seven divided by seven is one equals one two divided

32
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:17,060
by.

33
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:23,910
Same Same thing different symbol divided by the forward slash here it's a special division symbol here

34
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:34,590
two divided by four equals zero point five equals zero point five OK seven times seven times seven is

35
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:37,830
forty nine seven times seven is forty nine.

36
00:02:37,830 --> 00:02:42,350
So we just need to be careful in knowing what we are doing OK.

37
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:49,170
These are less common what we can say if it's a verb which are very common words outside of math and

38
00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:55,080
what we should say if we're actually saying the math problem saying the equation plus minus divided

39
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:56,700
by at times.

40
00:02:56,700 --> 00:03:02,460
Once you know those words though it's pretty easy and pretty simple and there's really nothing else

41
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:03,160
to know.

42
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:08,320
Of course if you get deeper into math there are lots more words and lots more things to describe.

43
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:16,200
But these are the basics and the most common words probably are these add subtract divide multiply.

44
00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:19,620
These are the most common out there in the English language.
