00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:07,590
So far in this lesson on technical language technical descriptions we've talked about things in sequence

2
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:09,330
and dates.

3
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:12,410
Now we're going to focus on symbols not every symbol.

4
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:14,010
There are billions of symbols.

5
00:00:14,010 --> 00:00:18,210
We're going to talk about the common symbols that you find on your keyboard.

6
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:23,340
And we're not going to talk about every one but we're going to talk about the ones that you come across

7
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:27,270
relatively often when we need to say them.

8
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:33,060
And when we don't need to say them this is one of the more confusing things that I find a lot of English

9
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:34,890
learners come across.

10
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:37,280
Should I say this or not.

11
00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:44,430
Is this symbol here as just a mark to let me know or to organize something so that I kind of know what's

12
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:48,230
going on or do I actually need to speak something here.

13
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:49,000
How do I know.

14
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:51,110
Well we can go through some of these things.

15
00:00:51,150 --> 00:00:51,710
OK.

16
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:57,720
I mean obviously you know at the end of a sentence you have this thing and it's called the period and

17
00:00:57,720 --> 00:00:59,270
you don't say period.

18
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:08,540
You don't say Mary had a cat named Bob period unless you're dictating nowadays.

19
00:01:08,910 --> 00:01:18,180
You can use your phone or your computer or whatever to speak and many kinds of software at the moment

20
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:23,340
require you to say period when you want to end the sentence.

21
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:28,470
So yes usually you don't need to but recently you need to more often.

22
00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:34,670
I often use dictation with my phone and I speak and I say Mary had a cat period.

23
00:01:34,830 --> 00:01:40,290
Her cat was yellow period to it writes down a period when I went to there are I guess what I'm trying

24
00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:47,070
to say is there are always some cases when you need to be able to actually say all of these otherwise

25
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:47,850
useless.

26
00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:48,080
All right.

27
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:50,000
This symbol it's called a percent.

28
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:57,240
Think you know it 70 percent of people living in love of love.

29
00:01:57,390 --> 00:01:57,920
OK.

30
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:06,000
This is a percent symbol percent symbol and it is almost always actually said when written almost always

31
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,350
actually said when written.

32
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:13,680
Sometimes you might see it just as a visual reference but usually when you come across it you should

33
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:14,730
read it.

34
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:15,750
OK.

35
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:21,930
We could say maybe a zero point two percent interest rate.

36
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:27,690
There will be some cases when you might see it in front of the number but you should still say zero

37
00:02:27,690 --> 00:02:29,370
point two percent.

38
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:36,750
So one of the difficult things when you're reading out some technical language is you'll see symbols

39
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:42,410
in different places and what you say is actually not the order that you're reading it in.

40
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:48,630
So you're reading percent zero point two sometimes you're saying zero point two percent.

41
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:53,160
It's the same for for example the dollar sign.

42
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:54,800
This is called a dollar sign.

43
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,070
And I'm sure you already know that.

44
00:02:56,070 --> 00:02:58,810
So we don't really need to focus on it in this lesson.

45
00:02:58,950 --> 00:03:01,200
But you would see something like that.

46
00:03:01,230 --> 00:03:08,300
You don't say dollar five and you don't say dollar sign five you say five dollars.

47
00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:16,410
So in many cases four different symbols you will have to read things out loud differently than your

48
00:03:16,410 --> 00:03:18,840
eyes actually see them.

49
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:19,530
All right.

50
00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:21,760
Let's go on to this one.

51
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:26,520
This one can be called a no sign a hash or pound.

52
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:29,030
When is it used for each of these.

53
00:03:29,070 --> 00:03:33,550
So the number sign is generally not spoken.

54
00:03:33,550 --> 00:03:38,670
OK if it's spoken you would just say no you won't say no sign I'll just say no.

55
00:03:38,670 --> 00:03:46,650
So if you see this written down somewhere things in order maybe you're calling out names number seven.

56
00:03:46,650 --> 00:03:47,940
Who's number seven.

57
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:49,220
Number seven here.

58
00:03:49,290 --> 00:03:49,520
OK.

59
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:50,550
So you would say just.

60
00:03:50,550 --> 00:03:51,690
Number seven.

61
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:54,250
Number five hundred fifty three maybe.

62
00:03:54,270 --> 00:03:59,100
I don't know maybe there is some sort of drawing and there's a random number in a bucket and you take

63
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:05,040
one out number 62 which is number 60 to see here number 60 to say no.

64
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:05,460
OK.

65
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:10,300
Generally it's there to just reference the number and we don't say this part.

66
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:13,050
OK hash it's also called the hash.

67
00:04:13,050 --> 00:04:20,040
This started to become much more popular recently in the last I don't know maybe ten years because it's

68
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:25,570
part of another word which is hash tag on social media.

69
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:30,530
It's a G on social media Twitter wave for Facebook.

70
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:32,990
Facebook is Facebook have hashtags.

71
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:41,220
I think so you see hashtags to let you know what's going on with the post that's been that's been shared

72
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:45,300
on your your home feed or whatever or what it's related to.

73
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:51,060
You can search for other posts that have the same idea or they're related to the same topic.

74
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:51,990
It's called the hash tag.

75
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:55,620
So when I'm recording this Instagram is quite popular.

76
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:58,400
That of course always changes from year to year.

77
00:04:58,430 --> 00:05:05,500
But let's say there's a hash tag insta insta good I think is the number one hashtag.

78
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:10,160
I'm not even sure what it means to be honest with you or hash tag.

79
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:15,830
I can make my own if I write my name here where you make where you post things on Instagram if it's

80
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:16,700
still there.

81
00:05:16,710 --> 00:05:20,220
Hashtag Luke pretty you say the word hashtag.

82
00:05:20,230 --> 00:05:23,150
OK so that's become much more popular recently.

83
00:05:23,170 --> 00:05:26,240
Pound is something that you hear on the phone.

84
00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:31,950
If you get an automated message on the phone they'll say please press pound once you're finished with

85
00:05:31,950 --> 00:05:36,450
your recording or when you're finished with your recording please press pound.

86
00:05:36,510 --> 00:05:39,010
So you'll see that symbol on the phone.

87
00:05:39,210 --> 00:05:43,470
And you push it if you'd like to speak with an operator please press pound.

88
00:05:43,470 --> 00:05:46,350
So you hear that often in a recorded message.

89
00:05:46,410 --> 00:05:53,630
So generally you won't need to say pound you might often more often say hashtag.

90
00:05:53,730 --> 00:05:58,140
And sometimes you might need to say no but not no sign.

91
00:05:58,290 --> 00:06:06,360
Now the next one is very common and sometimes it's said sometimes it's not said minus sign is just like

92
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:07,120
no sign.

93
00:06:07,150 --> 00:06:14,250
We don't say sign but we do say minus and we'll talk more about it when we're talking about math problems.

94
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:21,480
But we would say for example seven minus seven seven minus seven.

95
00:06:21,630 --> 00:06:30,400
Or sometimes we'll say I'll have tomatoes and onions minus cucumber minus cucumber.

96
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:33,480
That means please take away the cucumber.

97
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:35,790
Now sometimes it's a dash.

98
00:06:35,790 --> 00:06:42,690
And if it's written in a number not for an equation not for a math problem but in a number like in an

99
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:51,820
email address for example or maybe a user name then you will say dash dash dash OK.

100
00:06:51,890 --> 00:06:56,920
And you actually should speak dash for phone numbers don't actually say it.

101
00:06:56,970 --> 00:07:03,300
The best way to think of it is if you need to take action on that and actually input it actually input

102
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:05,420
input that then you should say it.

103
00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:14,580
For example if you're typing out someone's user name to find them then OK say dash B maybe a dash VBA

104
00:07:14,610 --> 00:07:15,720
whatever it is.

105
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:16,250
OK.

106
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:22,860
Phone numbers not don't say dash because if it's a phone number it's just there to separate the numbers

107
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:25,780
and you don't actually put that into the phone.

108
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:27,210
So don't say it.

109
00:07:27,630 --> 00:07:28,160
OK.

110
00:07:28,170 --> 00:07:31,620
Hyphens are four words for example.

111
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:33,040
Thirty two.

112
00:07:33,090 --> 00:07:40,530
We don't say 30 hyphen two but when we're talking about words when we're talking about sentences then

113
00:07:40,530 --> 00:07:45,120
we use hyphen is there a hyphen between 30 and 2.

114
00:07:45,150 --> 00:07:45,930
Yes there is.

115
00:07:45,930 --> 00:07:48,050
There is a hyphen between 30 and 2.

116
00:07:48,070 --> 00:07:48,270
OK.

117
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:56,940
So we can use the word hyphen to describe this thing between words but we don't actually speak the word

118
00:07:56,970 --> 00:08:00,120
hyphen when we're reading out a sentence.

119
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:01,650
Never never never.

120
00:08:01,650 --> 00:08:06,260
We only use the word hyphen to describe what that is between words.

121
00:08:06,270 --> 00:08:06,560
OK.

122
00:08:06,570 --> 00:08:14,970
So minus sign for math minus to take something away but we don't say sine dash for things like email

123
00:08:14,970 --> 00:08:19,850
addresses user names but not phone numbers and hyphen.

124
00:08:19,890 --> 00:08:23,460
But we don't say it it's just a name for what we see.

125
00:08:23,550 --> 00:08:27,910
If there's this symbol between words like this one.

126
00:08:27,910 --> 00:08:28,250
OK.

127
00:08:28,290 --> 00:08:31,630
I realize I've killed my s h here.

128
00:08:31,630 --> 00:08:33,420
So let me fix that.

129
00:08:33,420 --> 00:08:34,200
There we are.

130
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:35,220
Sorry sir.

131
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:36,340
OK.

132
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:44,610
So let's talk about underscore underscore we pretty much always say underscore when we see it sometimes

133
00:08:44,610 --> 00:08:51,090
it might be in a user name sometimes in an email address but because you actually need to put it in

134
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:53,830
to input it and if you don't it will be wrong.

135
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:59,760
You'll find the wrong person then it has to be said Steve underscore Steve at blah blah blah.

136
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:02,550
Dot com that is maybe an email address.

137
00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:03,600
So we should say it.

138
00:09:03,630 --> 00:09:06,030
We should say it the next one is parentheses.

139
00:09:06,030 --> 00:09:08,640
These are always pretty much always go together.

140
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,360
You don't see one alone.

141
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:12,180
You don't see just this one or this one.

142
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:18,270
So we pretty much always say parentheses will say the word parentheses first and then say the thing

143
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:19,740
inside of it.

144
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:27,910
Now sometimes we will just say Alex co-founder Alex co-founder that's his role or his.

145
00:09:28,050 --> 00:09:32,000
What he does in this company maybe this is at the end of an email.

146
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:38,550
Alex co-founder if if we want to make sure people know maybe we're on the phone that this is within

147
00:09:38,550 --> 00:09:48,000
parentheses maybe it's in a sentence you can say Alex parentheses co-founder Alex parentheses co-founder.

148
00:09:48,030 --> 00:09:53,780
OK so that's when we would actually say parentheses or if we're going to describe it you could say oh

149
00:09:53,850 --> 00:10:02,490
it's by the way co-founder is in parentheses co-founder is in Peru sees if it's a phone number though

150
00:10:02,550 --> 00:10:04,010
we don't say it.

151
00:10:04,050 --> 00:10:08,730
So if you see Parentheses in a phone number never say it because why not.

152
00:10:08,730 --> 00:10:14,010
Because when you're putting in the number you don't actually put that in you don't input it.

153
00:10:14,010 --> 00:10:20,550
So usually we don't need to say it because most of the time it's in that sort of situation.

154
00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:27,820
Often we don't need to actually say parentheses because it just tells us a little bit of extra information.

155
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:32,650
So only if it's necessary to know that it is inside of parentheses.

156
00:10:32,790 --> 00:10:34,170
Do we actually say it.

157
00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:40,080
And sometimes we can make the decision whether or not to say it based on whether or not we feel it's

158
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:45,870
important for people to know who are listening that it is inside parentheses.

159
00:10:45,870 --> 00:10:51,450
So quotes or quotation marks often tell us that something was said.

160
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:57,510
And so when we're reading something out we don't have to say quotation mark because it is.

161
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,240
So we're just saying what that person said.

162
00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:02,280
She said I can't I can't.

163
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:09,780
But sometimes maybe if she said isn't there and I just want to say I can't.

164
00:11:09,780 --> 00:11:16,050
And I want to make sure you know that it's something someone said and I'm not saying it.

165
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:23,050
Then I have to say by the way that's in quotes that's in quotes that's in quotation marks.

166
00:11:23,130 --> 00:11:24,640
Usually we'll say quotes.

167
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:27,250
So by the way I can't it's not what I'm saying.

168
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:28,410
It's in quotes.

169
00:11:28,410 --> 00:11:30,810
So we won't actually say quotation mark.

170
00:11:30,810 --> 00:11:31,430
I can't.

171
00:11:31,430 --> 00:11:32,700
Quotation mark.

172
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:33,240
No.

173
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:34,970
We'll say I can't.

174
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:45,150
That's in quotes or quote I can't quote I can't say we'll say either quote I can't or that's in quotation

175
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:50,580
marks or that's in quotations or that's in quotes.

176
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:52,740
This one as I mentioned is air quotes.

177
00:11:52,740 --> 00:12:00,050
If someone is looking at you she said I can't I can't I'm telling you that I'm not saying my own words.

178
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:03,180
I'm saying someone else's words.

179
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:10,770
And it's a way to sort of mark that forward slash and backslash almost always said because usually it's

180
00:12:10,770 --> 00:12:17,160
in a you are L most of the time when you see these it's in a U.R.L. you need to be able to type that

181
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:20,510
in when you're when you're putting in the U.R.L..

182
00:12:20,570 --> 00:12:23,500
So we'll say forward slash backslash.

183
00:12:23,550 --> 00:12:28,680
Sometimes it's just set as Slash if it's in a sentence for example.

184
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:30,260
And there are two options.

185
00:12:30,270 --> 00:12:38,010
For example you could have a banana or Apple and it's telling you that you can choose a banana slash

186
00:12:38,070 --> 00:12:46,300
apple banana slash Apple OK or sometimes you could say banana or apple banana or Apple.

187
00:12:46,310 --> 00:12:51,540
OK so you could say or there or you could say slash there if it's in a U R L it's very very important

188
00:12:51,540 --> 00:12:59,310
to make sure to say this one or this one because forward slash goes this way and backslash goes that

189
00:12:59,310 --> 00:12:59,850
way.

190
00:12:59,850 --> 00:13:02,730
So it's very important to say which one you're talking about.

191
00:13:02,730 --> 00:13:08,520
Comma is pretty much never said it's only said to describe what this thing is.

192
00:13:08,510 --> 00:13:10,570
This thing is called a comma.

193
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:11,820
This is a comma.

194
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:19,360
If you're doing dictation like I mentioned before then you might actually say comma I said comma that.

195
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:24,590
OK but most of the time you do not need to actually say it when you read it.

196
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:30,900
Ninety nine point nine nine percent unless you are dictating what about Colon.

197
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:37,080
What about Colon if you remember in our email class we used a colon to create a list.

198
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:45,030
It's called a colon colon and we used it to create one 2 three things or two things I think it was that

199
00:13:45,030 --> 00:13:47,370
needed to be done a request.

200
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:54,730
So we'll often say please do the following then we'll write a colon then we'll say 1 2 and 3.

201
00:13:54,750 --> 00:14:03,100
So usually you do not need to say colon colon unless you're describing something like what you're doing.

202
00:14:03,270 --> 00:14:06,650
And then I wrote colon 1 2 3.

203
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:13,350
But if you're actually just reading for example that email that we read in the class about writing emails

204
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:15,180
you do not need to say colon.

205
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:22,920
So this is very similar to comma and in fact semicolon is the same way most of the time you do not need

206
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:27,720
to read out semicolon unless you're describing what you're doing.

207
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:29,490
You need a semicolon here.

208
00:14:29,490 --> 00:14:34,480
I think if you put a semicolon there then the whole sentence will make more sense.

209
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:34,850
Oh yeah.

210
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:35,900
Good idea.

211
00:14:36,030 --> 00:14:44,580
So you need to know these things like commas colons periods to help other people maybe with their grammar

212
00:14:44,580 --> 00:14:46,730
with their sentences.

213
00:14:47,010 --> 00:14:53,910
Otherwise you don't need to actually say them an asterisk is usually used to reference or mentions something

214
00:14:53,910 --> 00:14:54,690
below.

215
00:14:54,690 --> 00:15:02,630
Maybe this is beside a name or a statement about a product on a box and then at the bottom you need

216
00:15:02,630 --> 00:15:04,950
to read more details about that.

217
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,750
So if you see an asterisk you don't need to say asterisk.

218
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:10,970
You just look at the bottom of the box.

219
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:15,410
So in that way it's kind of similar to these where you really only need to say it.

220
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:22,310
If you're talking about that thing or you really need to say oh there's an asterisk there I wonder what

221
00:15:22,310 --> 00:15:29,690
it says at the bottom of the page or at the bottom of the box star then is used on a phone if it's on

222
00:15:29,690 --> 00:15:33,820
a phone it's called a star if it's on a page a product a box.

223
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:35,770
It's called an asterisk.

224
00:15:35,780 --> 00:15:36,180
OK.

225
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:41,160
Sometimes you need to say you need to press star you need to press star.

226
00:15:41,330 --> 00:15:42,320
Usually not.

227
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:48,060
Not many things require you to push the star key but sometimes right.

228
00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:52,130
Sometimes on a computer keyboard it's an asterisk on a phone.

229
00:15:52,130 --> 00:15:52,880
It's a star.

230
00:15:52,940 --> 00:15:54,790
That's a simple way to remember it.

231
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:55,090
All right.

232
00:15:55,100 --> 00:16:02,690
Well how about this one the old classic period that we talked about at the beginning of our symbols

233
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:03,850
discussion.

234
00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:05,530
Well it's called a dot.

235
00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:12,470
It's called a period and it's called a point just like comma colon semicolon an asterisk.

236
00:16:12,470 --> 00:16:20,350
We typically don't need to and also hyphen we typically don't need to say this when we read it period.

237
00:16:20,390 --> 00:16:27,560
But as I mentioned earlier if you're dictating you do or if you're making a clear point about something

238
00:16:28,090 --> 00:16:31,660
and you want to focus on the fact that there's no way around it.

239
00:16:31,850 --> 00:16:33,850
I'm going tomorrow.

240
00:16:33,950 --> 00:16:35,120
I don't care if it rains.

241
00:16:35,450 --> 00:16:39,920
I don't care if you say no I am going period.

242
00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:45,440
The meaning of that period if I say it is there's no other option.

243
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:47,210
There's no alternative.

244
00:16:47,210 --> 00:16:52,040
I am very very clear about my opinion and nobody can tell me not to.

245
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:54,090
Nothing can stop me usually.

246
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:55,310
So it's very certain.

247
00:16:55,430 --> 00:16:57,710
This is the end period.

248
00:16:58,020 --> 00:16:59,600
Oh it's usually very serious.

249
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:00,360
OK.

250
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:07,360
Dot would be for things like email addresses so we can consider this one more like e-mail or a U.R.L.

251
00:17:07,810 --> 00:17:08,530
Web site.

252
00:17:08,540 --> 00:17:12,360
We always say dot com and a point for a number.

253
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:23,210
So for example zero point three or six point two or seven point one so point four numbers period four

254
00:17:23,210 --> 00:17:29,350
sentences and dot for you are L's e-mails and things like that.

255
00:17:29,420 --> 00:17:31,480
Hopefully you're clear on these symbols.

256
00:17:31,580 --> 00:17:37,700
There are lots of others certainly but at least you should have an idea about when you can use these

257
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:43,580
when you should say them when you shouldn't say them and when they're just meant to describe that thing

258
00:17:43,670 --> 00:17:48,880
and you only use it when you're talking about for example a hyphen you need a hyphen there.

259
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:52,390
I think really yes you need a hyphen there.

260
00:17:52,390 --> 00:17:52,990
Oh OK.

261
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:53,720
Add a hyphen.

262
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:56,560
Now let's go on and actually look at a real example.
