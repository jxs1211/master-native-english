1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:03,830
So let's get started with order ordering things.

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:08,640
When do we use the endings for numbers like you probably know first.

3
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:10,890
Why do we sometimes say 1.

4
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:16,870
Why do we sometimes say 1 s t or F I R S T.

5
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:21,510
OK well if we have one thing then we don't need to use this.

6
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:22,280
OK.

7
00:00:22,530 --> 00:00:23,540
We don't need to use that.

8
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:24,660
We just have one thing.

9
00:00:24,690 --> 00:00:27,150
So we say I have one apple OK.

10
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:29,710
There are two people we're just counting.

11
00:00:29,710 --> 00:00:32,820
OK but if things go in order.

12
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:39,510
If there is a sequence and we're focused on the sequence that means this one and then this one and then

13
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:46,120
this one and then this one and then this one there's a sequence then often we will use this.

14
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:54,810
The endings for numbers we use it very simply for days in the month all the way up to thirty first which

15
00:00:54,810 --> 00:00:58,730
is the longest a month can be the thirty first.

16
00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:03,910
So things in sequence not everything but often things in sequence.

17
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:08,610
Could you say my thirty first birthday.

18
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:09,340
Yes.

19
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:10,210
Yes you can.

20
00:01:10,230 --> 00:01:13,800
Thirty first birthday because birthdays are in sequence.

21
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:18,060
You can also say that you're thirty three years old.

22
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:23,580
You can certainly say that thirty three years old but you can say it's your thirty first birthday because

23
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:25,750
that's in sequence.

24
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:28,650
What else goes in order like that.

25
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:33,240
When else might we use this sort of language in sequence.

26
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:39,300
Well if we have something and then we get rid of it or we get another thing of the same type then we

27
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:44,610
can start to use this because we have one and then we have another of the same kind of thing.

28
00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:52,320
It's a kind of sequence so let's say I buy a bike by the company maybe you know the company track it's

29
00:01:52,370 --> 00:01:58,080
a bike company let's say I buy a track I have one track bike OK and I like it.

30
00:01:58,110 --> 00:02:01,580
So I decide well this one was cheap so I'll buy another one.

31
00:02:01,650 --> 00:02:03,530
Now I have two track bikes.

32
00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:07,470
Well this one this one tried to draw a bike.

33
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:09,450
Oh my God this is a terrible this bicycle.

34
00:02:09,450 --> 00:02:13,650
This one is my first track bike and this one.

35
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,560
Let's just say there's another one here.

36
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:18,450
This one is my two second.

37
00:02:18,450 --> 00:02:23,700
Now I know that you probably know this but I just want to be very clear when we use it and when we don't

38
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:30,540
usually if it is a sequence of things maybe it's my third bike and my second track bike that's possible.

39
00:02:30,570 --> 00:02:34,200
Third bike second track bike totally fine.

40
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:35,030
Totally fine.

41
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:41,010
Let's just read through these very quickly just so that you know the pronunciation and then I want to

42
00:02:41,010 --> 00:02:43,120
talk about the floors of a building.

43
00:02:43,130 --> 00:02:43,760
OK.

44
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:46,210
This one twenty first.

45
00:02:46,230 --> 00:02:49,760
This one 30 second 30 second.

46
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:52,640
This one third this one.

47
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:54,420
Seventy fourth.

48
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:57,420
This one sixty fifth.

49
00:02:57,420 --> 00:02:58,730
This one's tough to save.

50
00:02:58,730 --> 00:03:04,110
Fifth fifth sixty fifth.

51
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:06,840
Another one that's tough to say is the next one.

52
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:09,550
One hundred and six.

53
00:03:09,930 --> 00:03:11,690
Six.

54
00:03:12,330 --> 00:03:13,650
Six.

55
00:03:13,650 --> 00:03:15,590
You have to actually say six.

56
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:17,970
And then with a t h sound.

57
00:03:17,970 --> 00:03:21,420
Sixty six sixty six.

58
00:03:21,930 --> 00:03:23,550
One hundred and six.

59
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:29,090
Forty seventh forty seventh seven seven.

60
00:03:29,850 --> 00:03:32,040
Adding t h eighty eighth.

61
00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:35,310
So this one we have a kind of ay ay ay.

62
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:36,780
We don't say eight.

63
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:40,540
Like that we just say eight and we stop the voice.

64
00:03:41,010 --> 00:03:41,430
Eight.

65
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:42,050
OK.

66
00:03:42,330 --> 00:03:45,420
Nine nine nine.

67
00:03:45,450 --> 00:03:48,220
So when it has t h we do have to make that sound.

68
00:03:48,240 --> 00:04:03,110
And what about this one if it's on an even ten 10th 20th 30th 40 50 if this is 50 50.

69
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,280
If fiftieth OK.

70
00:04:05,450 --> 00:04:10,400
Now it gets a little different if it's teens but those are all the same except for twelve.

71
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:16,870
So this one is twelve twelve twelve.

72
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:19,870
It's difficult twelfth than the other ones are all the same.

73
00:04:19,910 --> 00:04:27,590
13th 14th 15th 16th all of them are T H and you just say the number thirteen and then.

74
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:33,830
Except you have to be careful about this and this you gotta watch out for that pronunciation.

75
00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:35,220
This is death.

76
00:04:35,330 --> 00:04:37,060
This is death.

77
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:40,830
If it's a ten then we use it.

78
00:04:41,090 --> 00:04:54,020
If it's a team then we use thirtieth 40 if fiftieth 13th 14th 15th 15th and the 15th are very different

79
00:04:54,050 --> 00:04:57,260
but it's the tone that we also have to pay attention to.

80
00:04:57,620 --> 00:05:03,500
So in a building when you're describing the floor in the building because they're in sequence going

81
00:05:03,590 --> 00:05:11,510
up they are in sequence going up then we're going to use these endings as the floor names.

82
00:05:11,510 --> 00:05:13,630
So you have a tall building here.

83
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:24,320
OK and maybe this is the 30 second 30 second floor the 30 second floor the 50 second floor the 50 second

84
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:24,880
floor.

85
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:30,290
So once you know the endings and you know how to say them it should be easy but just pay attention to

86
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:35,520
the fact that these numbers become the names of those things.

87
00:05:35,690 --> 00:05:37,160
And if we say how old are you.

88
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:38,120
I'm thirty three.

89
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:41,100
That's not the name of your age right.

90
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,820
That's not the name of your birthday.

91
00:05:42,830 --> 00:05:49,820
But if we say it's my thirty third birthday or my fortieth birthday that's kind of the name of your

92
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:51,190
birthday isn't it.

93
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:52,450
The name of your birthday.

94
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:58,690
So it helps us to name things and specify exactly which thing we're talking about.

95
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:04,430
Which floor you're going to I'm going to the eighty second floor.

96
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:07,110
Wow that's pretty high up eighty second floor.

97
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:07,710
Cool.

98
00:06:07,730 --> 00:06:09,960
You live very high up.

99
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:10,940
OK.

100
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:20,270
Or the 13th floor and if if you go into many buildings in Western countries you will not see a 13th

101
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:23,210
floor on the buttons in the elevator.

102
00:06:23,210 --> 00:06:24,010
Why not.

103
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:30,270
Because 13 in a lot of Western countries is an unlucky number.

104
00:06:30,350 --> 00:06:31,370
It's a bad number.

105
00:06:31,370 --> 00:06:34,290
So you won't see a 13th floor for that reason.

106
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:37,130
In many places many places not all but many.

107
00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:37,680
All right.

108
00:06:37,790 --> 00:06:38,660
That's pretty simple.

109
00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:40,520
I realize hopefully it's clear.
