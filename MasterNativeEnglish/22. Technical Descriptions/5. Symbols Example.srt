1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:07,890
Let's actually look at an example a real life example so that we can put into practice actually use

2
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:13,650
some of the things we've been talking about so far in this lesson about technical descriptions.

3
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:15,180
So when you look at a notice.

4
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:18,150
Pay attention to how we mention dates.

5
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:23,660
Also pay attention to how we mention symbols and when symbols are not read.

6
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:29,460
I'm going to read through this then we'll just quickly talk about why certain things are said and why

7
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:31,410
certain things are not said.

8
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:31,800
All right.

9
00:00:32,010 --> 00:00:35,310
So let's read through this if you can do it in your head.

10
00:00:35,310 --> 00:00:36,440
Just before I do it.

11
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:49,510
That's great from March 14th to April 18th 2013 cafe K L dot com will be under maintenance.

12
00:00:49,530 --> 00:01:00,360
We apologize for any inconvenience caused those with questions can email Miss Alice Munro at K L underscore

13
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:07,410
B dot t r i x dash 4 3 9 at Yahoo.

14
00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:19,020
Dot com dot c n or call the store at 1 4 1 9 7 5 2 7 3 8 3.

15
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:28,110
Please visit one of our two locations during the following store hours Monday to Friday 8 a.m. to 10

16
00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:33,720
p.m. Saturday and Sunday 10 a.m. to 6 p.m..

17
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:35,230
OK now let's look at this.

18
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:43,110
I want to mention one thing I didn't say this because this is only here because my computer is putting

19
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:46,210
the rest of this email on the next line.

20
00:01:46,230 --> 00:01:49,010
Actually if this were on one line that wouldn't be there.

21
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:53,450
So I didn't say dash there because it's not a real it's not a real dash.

22
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:56,510
It's something my computer my computer did.

23
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:57,040
All right.

24
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:58,500
Now let's start with the date.

25
00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:01,080
So I said notice that this is not an M..

26
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:01,510
OK.

27
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:09,090
So sometimes dates are written just as the month instead of 0 3 just written as 3 but I added words

28
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:13,780
I said from OK from March 14th.

29
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:19,440
Well why didn't I say from March 14th 2013.

30
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:25,560
The reason is because I'm saying it the second time so I'm not going to say it this time from March

31
00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:30,090
14th to April 18th 2013.

32
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:37,920
I could say 2013 but I am adding T H to the 18 and T H to the 14 cafe K L dot com I'm saying dot here

33
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:42,720
because it is a U R L K you are l will be under maintenance.

34
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,100
That means it's being fixed.

35
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:46,810
We apologize for any inconvenience caused.

36
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:52,260
Again this this one here is just to basically say hey we move this to the next line.

37
00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:54,900
So we definitely don't need to read those.

38
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:55,240
OK.

39
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:59,450
Those with questions can email is this is an abbreviation.

40
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:04,920
Alice Munro at now we need to say everything here every symbol because you have to actually put this

41
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:10,430
in K L underscore B dot t r i x.

42
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:17,280
The reason I didn't say Trix is because Trix can also be spelled as T R I C K S so I'm going to say

43
00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:25,660
T R I X dash 4 3 9 T R I X dash 4 3 9 at Yahoo.

44
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:35,160
Dot com dot C. And so we say everything here this is going to be dash instead of Hyphen because it's

45
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:36,820
in an email address.

46
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:38,130
OK now what about this one.

47
00:03:38,130 --> 00:03:39,960
Why did I say at here.

48
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:42,800
Well sometimes we use this symbol.

49
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:43,100
Right.

50
00:03:43,110 --> 00:03:44,640
This is at at.

51
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:50,670
This is the at symbol I think you know that that's very basic but because a phone number is after this

52
00:03:50,850 --> 00:03:54,060
we can say at here we don't usually do that.

53
00:03:54,090 --> 00:03:57,990
Usually a colon will not be set as at.

54
00:03:57,990 --> 00:03:59,610
It will just be a list.

55
00:03:59,610 --> 00:04:04,440
For example like this one we don't say anything here but here it's a special case.

56
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:07,980
We have a phone number after it so we can say at.

57
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:11,330
If you don't say it or call the store 1 4 1 9.

58
00:04:11,330 --> 00:04:11,940
OK.

59
00:04:11,970 --> 00:04:18,930
Notice in the phone number we don't say parentheses we don't say hyphen or dash because we don't put

60
00:04:18,930 --> 00:04:28,110
that in the phone and we don't say this during the following store hours notice that I added from Monday

61
00:04:28,110 --> 00:04:33,740
to Friday I could say between Monday and Friday from Monday to Friday.

62
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:41,400
OK here I'll say from from 8:00 a.m. to 10 p.m. but I'm not really saying from because of the colon

63
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:48,210
I'm saying beginning here to this time from 8:00 a.m. to 10:00 p.m. I don't say this Don't say that

64
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:56,970
K then I say Saturday and Sunday not from Saturday to Sunday but just Saturday and Sunday I could I

65
00:04:56,970 --> 00:05:03,190
suppose but usually because this is only two days I'll use and to make it simpler.

66
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:11,420
Saturday and Sunday from 10:00 a.m. to 6 p.m. or between 10:00 a.m. and 6:00 p.m. so hopefully that

67
00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:18,500
gives you a better feeling about how some of these symbols and how dates can actually be used in real

68
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:22,050
life situations like a notice on a Web site.

69
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:22,520
OK.

70
00:05:22,550 --> 00:05:27,680
There are lots of other examples but hopefully you have a better feeling about these and when you're

71
00:05:27,770 --> 00:05:34,250
looking around on the Internet or you see this kind of thing notice and phone numbers email addresses.

72
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:40,310
Pay attention to how the symbols are used and try to keep in mind some of the things that we've talked

73
00:05:40,310 --> 00:05:47,180
about with regards to how to use those when to say them and when not to say them.

74
00:05:47,210 --> 00:05:47,480
OK.

75
00:05:47,510 --> 00:05:50,270
Now let's go on and talk about numbers.
