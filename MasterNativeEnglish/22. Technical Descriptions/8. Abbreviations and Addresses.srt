1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:06,870
So we've talked about the most important stuff within this this lesson about numbers and dates about

2
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:07,500
symbols.

3
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:13,500
These are the things you see most often but I feel like because this is the class on technical description

4
00:00:13,730 --> 00:00:19,020
and that we're trying to get through this stuff which is what many people would say a little less interesting

5
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:25,590
it's important to make sure that you're clear on one point about the difference between abbreviations

6
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:26,910
and acronyms.

7
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:31,800
What's an abbreviation an abbreviation is when you have one word that is shorthand.

8
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:40,560
One example would be S T which is the abbreviation of the word street one word shortened one you probably

9
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:49,380
know D R is the abbreviation of the word doctor or sometimes drive sometimes P H L is the abbreviation

10
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:57,600
of philosophy e t c is the abbreviation of the word et cetera et cetera or etc. People say both et cetera

11
00:00:57,660 --> 00:00:58,350
et cetera.

12
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:05,250
Now notice that when we write abbreviations we usually have this period at the end to market but sometimes

13
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:11,550
it becomes so common that it's basically the only thing we say and we often get rid of that if that's

14
00:01:11,550 --> 00:01:12,180
the case.

15
00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:19,800
Example this one we often just say now an app and we don't even write the period anymore.

16
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:26,970
This is short for application because it's so commonly said as app now instead of application we often

17
00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:32,010
just get rid of that period and say app and now we say things like apps.

18
00:01:32,010 --> 00:01:33,390
What do you do for a living.

19
00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:35,910
Oh I build apps I build apps.

20
00:01:35,910 --> 00:01:36,200
OK.

21
00:01:36,220 --> 00:01:40,640
So that's very common and because it's so common we get rid of the period.

22
00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:49,650
Now what about an acronym an acronym is a way to shorten things but each letter is capital capitalized

23
00:01:49,860 --> 00:02:01,920
and each letter stands for or represents its own word for example and B A or BBC or a T M A.T.M. for

24
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:06,410
example stands for automatic teller machine.

25
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:12,720
One mistake people often make is that they'll say I need to go to the A.T.M. machine what people should

26
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:18,690
say is I need to go to the A.T.M. not I need to go to the A.T.M. machine because if you're saying that

27
00:02:18,690 --> 00:02:25,920
you're saying automatic teller machine machine I've made that mistake before as well but it's it's something

28
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,540
that you'll hear quite often.

29
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:35,880
So each first letter is used in the word and some of them are really long like scuba if you hear people

30
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:39,180
say I'm going to go scuba diving.

31
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:43,560
That's a common word means you're going to go underwater and breathe underwater.

32
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:50,580
But because each letter is kind of a long thing it's much easier just to say scuba scuba gear scuba

33
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:55,430
diving write great scuba spot or a location for scuba diving.

34
00:02:55,530 --> 00:03:00,930
So that's the difference between acronyms and abbreviations since we've talked about abbreviations we

35
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:06,840
should just very quickly go over addresses because you do see addresses from time to time so you'll

36
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:13,050
typically have the street first and then the building and then sometimes another part of the location

37
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:20,010
and we might then under that have the state and what's called the zip code of the city the state and

38
00:03:20,010 --> 00:03:27,780
the zip code or if it's in Canada or the province the city the province and the zip code zip code tells

39
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:30,600
you where in the world or where in the country it is.

40
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:31,450
It's a number.

41
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:36,480
So two Bay s t means street 200 Bay Street.

42
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:38,070
Sweet sweet.

43
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:42,890
It's kind of like room 180 sometimes 180 instead of one hundred eighty.

44
00:03:42,990 --> 00:03:46,770
Royal Court CTC o u r t.

45
00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:52,050
OK so this is how we would read that 200 Bay Street Suite 180 royal court.

46
00:03:52,050 --> 00:03:52,680
Pretty simple.

47
00:03:52,680 --> 00:04:02,130
This one apartment two building 18 apartment two building so AAPT is Apartment B L DG The Site B L G.D.

48
00:04:02,130 --> 00:04:06,750
is building and sometimes things are abbreviated differently in different places.

49
00:04:06,990 --> 00:04:12,640
So for example in England and America things might be abbreviated a little differently.

50
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:17,340
So apartment two building 18 5 8 9 9.

51
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:21,480
So if it's an address you don't need to say five thousand eight hundred ninety nine.

52
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:22,180
No.

53
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:30,150
5 just say the numbers if it's an address 5 8 9 9 Callister Boulevard a boulevard is a big road.

54
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:30,870
Boulevard.

55
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:31,150
OK.

56
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:35,180
Callister Boulevard De Moyne the Moyne.

57
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:37,050
This is pronounced do Moin.

58
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:41,090
I know it looks like death's Moin is but it's pronounced de.

59
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:45,810
And then Moy in Des Moines Des Moines Iowa.

60
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:49,440
So in America states always have two letters.

61
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:50,350
It's a kind of an.

62
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:51,980
It's a special abbreviation.

63
00:04:51,990 --> 00:04:53,540
It's a special sort of code.

64
00:04:53,610 --> 00:04:58,980
For example I come from Ohio and that one is O H New York is NY.

65
00:04:59,060 --> 00:04:59,270
OK.

66
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:01,180
So Iowa is I.

67
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:01,980
A.

68
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:03,540
Des Moines Iowa.

69
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:04,200
They're all different.

70
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:04,940
There are 50.

71
00:05:05,010 --> 00:05:06,780
OK then you have the zip code.

72
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:09,810
DES MOINES Iowa 7 8 5 5 4.

73
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:12,350
So you also read this one just like the street.

74
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:16,360
You don't say seven the eight thousand five hundred fifty four.

75
00:05:16,410 --> 00:05:17,550
Just say the number.

76
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:23,100
So that's how you would read addresses and that's how you would include the abbreviations notice for

77
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:26,250
the abbreviations we say the whole thing usually for apps.

78
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:30,520
We don't because it's so common to shorten it for acronyms we don't.

79
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:34,820
Because that's the reason we make the acronym because it's shorter.

80
00:05:34,950 --> 00:05:38,880
But for most abbreviations we'll say the whole word.

81
00:05:38,910 --> 00:05:39,240
All right.

82
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:46,920
So we've covered a lot in this lesson we've covered how to say dates we've covered how to talk about

83
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:53,080
addresses abbreviations acronyms numbers symbols things in order.

84
00:05:53,130 --> 00:05:57,900
We've talked about a lot of things including math problems a lot in this lesson.

85
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:00,750
And the best way to really practice it is to look out for it.

86
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:05,700
And when you see it the things that we went over in this lesson whether it's a long number or a Web

87
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:12,870
site U.R.L. or an email address or the address of some place or an abbreviation anything related to

88
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:15,330
what we talked about a symbol that's used.

89
00:06:15,390 --> 00:06:16,920
Speak it out loud.

90
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:17,880
Just say it out loud.

91
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:21,000
That's the best way for you to get used to saying it.

92
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:26,310
One of the problems with these is not that they're hard but it's that it's hard to do it quickly and

93
00:06:26,310 --> 00:06:33,480
when we say these things things that are related to technical descriptions it's tough to say it quickly

94
00:06:33,490 --> 00:06:34,520
it's tough to get it out.

95
00:06:34,530 --> 00:06:35,820
So you have to do it a lot.

96
00:06:35,850 --> 00:06:40,520
And the best way to do it is just to practice next time you type in it.

97
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,630
You are all quickly say it out loud.

98
00:06:43,010 --> 00:06:43,330
OK.

99
00:06:43,350 --> 00:06:46,380
That's the best way to actually get the feeling for it.

100
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:48,780
The best way to get comfortable with it.

101
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:49,290
Good luck.

102
00:06:49,290 --> 00:06:50,700
See you in the next lesson.
