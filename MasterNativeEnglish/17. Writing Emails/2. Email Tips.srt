1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,830
OK the first thing that you need to know when you're writing an email.
1

2
00:00:03,930 --> 00:00:09,920
The first thing you need to think about is that the style you use should not always be the same.
2

3
00:00:09,930 --> 00:00:14,460
You don't want to use the same style for your friend that you do with.
3

4
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:17,640
For example a co-worker or a colleague.
4

5
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:21,740
So always think about before you get started writing an email.
5

6
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:23,520
Why am I writing this email.
6

7
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:25,650
What's my purpose.
7

8
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:26,790
What's the reason.
8

9
00:00:26,790 --> 00:00:30,000
And then the style should follow that purpose.
9

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,150
If you're trying to accomplish something for example by getting information you shouldn't ask a lot
10

11
00:00:36,150 --> 00:00:39,110
of questions about unrelated things.
11

12
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:42,650
OK but you might do that if you're writing a personal email.
12

13
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:48,530
You might ask some more general questions and the email might be longer if it's more personal.
13

14
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:55,590
You might describe more things but if you're writing a more professional e-mail if you add a lot of
14

15
00:00:55,590 --> 00:01:03,150
words that are unnecessary or you make a lot of extra points or say a lot then it's possible that what
15

16
00:01:03,150 --> 00:01:08,830
you're trying to get or maybe the question you're trying to get answered may be missed.
16

17
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:16,020
So it's important to keep in mind that generally a more casual email will be or can be more relaxed
17

18
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:23,730
and longer and then a professional one should be shorter unless it needs to be longer for some specific
18

19
00:01:23,730 --> 00:01:24,360
reason.
19

20
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:31,260
But the goal should be to try to keep it as short and clean and efficient as possible.
20

21
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:35,060
So when you write a professional email try your best to be efficient.
21

22
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:37,250
Don't waste space.
22

23
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:43,100
Keep it simple keep it really simple when you're writing a personal e-mail.
23

24
00:01:43,230 --> 00:01:45,210
Or maybe one that's more casual.
24

25
00:01:45,210 --> 00:01:49,870
You can have a bit more let's call it flowery language.
25

26
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:55,090
Sometimes it's called flowery language you can use extra you can say what you want to say.
26

27
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,660
You can tell a story whatever you want to do.
27

28
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:58,800
So they're very different.
28

29
00:01:59,010 --> 00:02:02,220
So the second one is to separate the purpose from the body.
29

30
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:08,550
In other words the body of the email is maybe the largest section maybe you're answering someone else's
30

31
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:11,590
question and the body is your reply.
31

32
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:17,070
Basically what you're saying but you want to know some things as well or you want to ask some questions
32

33
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:22,360
in return you shouldn't mix those questions in with the body.
33

34
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:29,850
If you're writing as a way to get something from somebody make sure that separate from the main chunk
34

35
00:02:29,850 --> 00:02:32,530
of the email make sure that's on its own.
35

36
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:36,690
So you have the you know you're answering their e-mail here.
36

37
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:42,290
Then go down to lines and write your own question.
37

38
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:43,640
That's what you want to know.
38

39
00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:45,870
Don't mix it in over here.
39

40
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:51,840
If there are three or four questions mixed in with this then they feel the other person who receives
40

41
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,920
your e-mail feels exhausted.
41

42
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:00,410
Which question do I need to answer and they might just say I can't find all those questions.
42

43
00:03:00,450 --> 00:03:04,590
So it's very important to separate those and that's a general email tip.
43

44
00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:09,780
Now when you're writing a professional email you want to probably if you need something if you're asking
44

45
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:12,800
for something use a list.
45

46
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:19,990
We often say for example I would like the following.
46

47
00:03:20,010 --> 00:03:22,450
So it's clearly separate from everything else.
47

48
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:29,950
One two three or dash dash dash and those don't even need to be full sentences.
48

49
00:03:29,970 --> 00:03:30,900
That's fine.
49

50
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:36,690
So whatever you want to get from the other side the person you're writing to make sure that that is
50

51
00:03:36,690 --> 00:03:39,660
clearly separated from everything else.
51

52
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:43,050
Otherwise it may be missed.
52

53
00:03:43,050 --> 00:03:46,230
So number one make sure the style fits your purpose.
53

54
00:03:46,230 --> 00:03:48,930
Number two make sure what you would like.
54

55
00:03:48,930 --> 00:03:54,720
The other person to reply to you about is separate from everything else in the email.
55

56
00:03:54,720 --> 00:04:00,770
If you have other stuff in the email maybe it's just that if it's a very quick email that's OK.
56

57
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:01,080
All right.
57

58
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:08,160
Tip number three if you're writing an email to someone you want to be careful about when you use dear
58

59
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:11,200
you probably know that some e-mails can begin with dear.
59

60
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:13,330
I want to say be careful with that.
60

61
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:14,460
When would you use dear.
61

62
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:20,310
Well you might use dear if you're writing to someone you don't know for the very first time and that
62

63
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:26,970
person has a higher status or maybe you have absolutely no idea who they are.
63

64
00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:29,140
You just have a name you say dear.
64

65
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:30,590
Dr. Stevens.
65

66
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:33,300
OK it's the first communication.
66

67
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:36,780
It's very formal or it's very close.
67

68
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:42,630
If you're writing a letter for example or a card to your grandmother then again you would use deer for
68

69
00:04:42,630 --> 00:04:43,710
that dear grandma.
69

70
00:04:43,890 --> 00:04:50,730
So deer can be used affectionately for for example relatives who were very very close to and deer can
70

71
00:04:50,730 --> 00:04:57,660
also be used for very formal situations in which we don't really know the other person we're talking
71

72
00:04:57,660 --> 00:04:58,110
to.
72

73
00:04:58,110 --> 00:05:01,760
However if you have an going relationship with them.
73

74
00:05:01,850 --> 00:05:03,860
You emailed back and forth regularly.
74

75
00:05:03,910 --> 00:05:04,860
Don't use dear.
75

76
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,610
Just use Hi.
76

77
00:05:06,730 --> 00:05:07,720
And then the name.
77

78
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:09,250
Hi Dr. Stevens.
78

79
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:11,890
Or just begin with Dr. Stevens.
79

80
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:14,470
Or you could say hello Dr. Stevens.
80

81
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,120
Hello Dr. Stevens.
81

82
00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:18,000
OK so those are common.
82

83
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:18,850
Those are common.
83

84
00:05:18,850 --> 00:05:23,450
Now we could use hay but not probably not for Dr. Stevens.
84

85
00:05:23,530 --> 00:05:28,930
Hay is much more casual much more relaxed very casual.
85

86
00:05:28,930 --> 00:05:35,950
So I just want you to be aware of deer and that it's actually not as common as many people who are learning
86

87
00:05:35,950 --> 00:05:41,280
English may think it is our last tip is perfect punctuation.
87

88
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:41,980
What does that mean.
88

89
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:46,640
So these marks we use is called a period.
89

90
00:05:46,690 --> 00:05:48,650
This is called a comma.
90

91
00:05:48,670 --> 00:05:54,730
These marks that we use when we're writing these are these are called punctuation.
91

92
00:05:54,730 --> 00:06:00,520
We use them to mark our sentences and I just want to say if you're going to write an email make sure
92

93
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:07,010
it's grammatically correct English speakers tend to be very sensitive to things that are not perfect.
93

94
00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:11,990
If it's easy to make them perfect writing that isn't absolutely clear all right.
94

95
00:06:12,010 --> 00:06:22,390
It's OK but if you for example write in fact and then you have a space here comma space here I'd like
95

96
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:24,430
to whatever blah blah blah.
96

97
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:31,760
OK it's wrong it's wrong and it's obviously written by probably a non-native English speaker.
97

98
00:06:31,810 --> 00:06:37,870
So all you have to do is learn the simple rules of punctuation and make sure that your email is perfect
98

99
00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:39,250
before you send it out.
99

100
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:40,770
There should be no space here.
100

101
00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:42,820
There should be one space here.
101

102
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:47,780
OK so it should be in fact comma no space.
102

103
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:50,670
I'd like to add it's the same for a period.
103

104
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:55,860
If we end a sentence at all Let's imagine this is the end of a sentence.
104

105
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:58,480
However comma space I.
105

106
00:06:58,510 --> 00:06:58,820
OK.
106

107
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:01,500
So we have the end of a sentence no space here.
107

108
00:07:01,510 --> 00:07:03,770
One space here OK.
108

109
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:07,350
And then however capital letter at the beginning of the sentence.
109

110
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,900
Very important if this is a small h.
110

111
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,960
It looks like a text message very unprofessional.
111

112
00:07:13,150 --> 00:07:14,380
No space here.
112

113
00:07:14,380 --> 00:07:20,080
One space here and then I and I again should always be capitalized.
113

114
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:21,520
We can't write it like that.
114

115
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:27,430
So this kind of basic stuff if you're writing more professional emails and you're communicating with
115

116
00:07:27,430 --> 00:07:37,030
people by email with incorrect basic punctuation and maybe for example not capitalizing I could capitalize
116

117
00:07:37,510 --> 00:07:43,150
not capitalizing I or the beginning of a sentence like that they might not read it.
117

118
00:07:43,270 --> 00:07:50,230
I often get emails from people and sometimes if I see that someone has not taken the time to carefully
118

119
00:07:50,230 --> 00:07:56,980
read read through what they wrote and correct small things I go I think to myself This person doesn't
119

120
00:07:56,980 --> 00:08:02,560
really care about communicating with me or else they would have taken the time to fix these are very
120

121
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:05,860
basic these very basic things and they are very simple.
121

122
00:08:05,890 --> 00:08:14,110
All you need to know basically is what I just said capitalize the beginning of a sentence I and have
122

123
00:08:14,110 --> 00:08:20,860
no spaces before a comma or a period or an exclamation or any other mark and one space after.
123

124
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:28,270
So make sure to make sure to read through your emails before you send them download a plug in called
124

125
00:08:28,510 --> 00:08:29,550
grammarly.
125

126
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:31,850
I'm not being paid by grammarly to say it.
126

127
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:33,510
It's a good plug in.
127

128
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:34,230
It's a good app.
128

129
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,640
You can you can download it.
129

130
00:08:35,650 --> 00:08:36,860
I think for your computer.
130

131
00:08:36,970 --> 00:08:44,680
But you can also have it as a plugin for for example Safari or Google Chrome and GRC and them a are
131

132
00:08:44,850 --> 00:08:45,710
they are why.
132

133
00:08:45,910 --> 00:08:46,630
It's awesome.
133

134
00:08:46,630 --> 00:08:52,000
It can pick out the things that are incorrect and make your emails come across much more professionally.
134

135
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:52,400
OK.
135

136
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:57,540
So those are four tips to keep in mind when you are writing emails.
136

137
00:08:57,550 --> 00:09:00,040
Now let's go through a couple of examples.
