00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:05,730
So far in this email class we've looked at some tips that we need to keep in mind when we're writing

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:06,240
emails.

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:11,590
We've also looked at a personal email from Sarah to Kate.

4
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:16,680
And now we're going to look at a professional email and how we can do one of these well some of the

5
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:17,570
basics.

6
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:25,140
The first thing you might notice here is that there is very little extra unnecessary stuff here.

7
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:31,380
There is no FLUFF FLUFF as sort of stuff that's there but doesn't have much content.

8
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:32,220
It's called fluff.

9
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:35,430
It can be used in lots of different lots of different situations.

10
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:39,600
We also said flowery language no flowery language here at all.

11
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:42,650
It's very concise very concise.

12
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:45,630
That means there's no fat no fluff.

13
00:00:45,630 --> 00:00:48,330
It's very succinct very succinct.

14
00:00:48,330 --> 00:00:50,940
No more is said than needs to be said.

15
00:00:51,230 --> 00:00:55,230
OK so let's read through the e-mail then we'll talk about it a bit.

16
00:00:55,230 --> 00:00:58,770
Steve we got an order this week from a client in Canada.

17
00:00:58,830 --> 00:01:02,640
I need price estimates on materials for the following quantities.

18
00:01:02,650 --> 00:01:06,880
Ten thousand medium sized balloons 300 hand pumps.

19
00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:10,290
Get back to me A.S.A.P. with these estimates.

20
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:11,620
Thanks Alan.

21
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:15,120
Very very succinct very very clear.

22
00:01:15,220 --> 00:01:17,030
There's no way to misunderstand this.

23
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:21,520
There's no long introduction paragraph like Hey Steve how are you doing.

24
00:01:21,510 --> 00:01:28,560
Hope the kids are well it's not usually necessary when you have two people who work together or know

25
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:36,480
each other professionally it's not necessary get down to business get down to business don't waste time

26
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:36,980
OK.

27
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:40,170
Now what is the relationship between Steve and Alan.

28
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:41,750
Well they know each other very well.

29
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:42,830
How do we know that.

30
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:44,250
Well he just says his name.

31
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:47,140
He doesn't say Dear Steve doesn't use mister.

32
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:50,120
He doesn't say Hello there Steve.

33
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:56,820
That would be OK but just saying Steve gives it a feeling of what these two probably communicate every

34
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:58,920
day or at least very very often.

35
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:00,960
Maybe a couple of times per week.

36
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:08,130
We got an order this week from a client in Canada so that means that Steve knows everything about what

37
00:02:08,130 --> 00:02:09,540
an order means.

38
00:02:09,540 --> 00:02:15,390
So they have a previous history of working together and I need estimates on materials.

39
00:02:15,390 --> 00:02:22,680
So they obviously they obviously have some previous history probably a lot and a pretty close working

40
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:23,700
relationship.

41
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:27,840
Client is someone who maybe you're doing business with.

42
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:30,440
It's similar to a customer estimates.

43
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:32,770
This is a close guess.

44
00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:38,910
Basically if someone says Can you give me an estimate on how much it would cost to fix my car that means

45
00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:45,120
you're not telling me exactly how much it would cost to fix my car but you're trying to give me a close

46
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:48,270
number about nine hundred dollars.

47
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:50,310
Well it might be more than 900.

48
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:54,520
It might be less than 900 but you're giving me an estimate.

49
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:55,260
That's a noun.

50
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:58,320
But estimate can be a verb is a verb.

51
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:01,260
Estimate estimate different pronunciation.

52
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:05,190
Same spelling on materials for the following quantities.

53
00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:11,140
So we can often use this structure the following something I need the following.

54
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:13,510
Please give me details on the following.

55
00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:17,580
Then you use this to dots on top of each other.

56
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:25,440
This is called a colon a colon and a colon is used when we're going to usually say some information

57
00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:26,780
in order here.

58
00:03:26,850 --> 00:03:29,300
We've made a list of two things.

59
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:36,960
This is a very good way of asking for something because it's not mixed in with the rest of the email

60
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:38,560
with the body of the email.

61
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:41,860
The first paragraph here it's separated.

62
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:45,270
That's very important because it can no longer be missed.

63
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:47,070
He can not misunderstand.

64
00:03:47,070 --> 00:03:52,580
He needs these two things this and this and they're not even sentences.

65
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:55,820
Please give me ten thousand medium sized balloons.

66
00:03:55,830 --> 00:04:01,210
It's not even a sentence just says ten thousand medium sized balloons 300 hand pumps.

67
00:04:01,290 --> 00:04:06,290
If you make sentences it's more possible for there to be confusion.

68
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:10,790
So by keeping it very concise making lists for what we want.

69
00:04:10,890 --> 00:04:18,090
Using the following and then a colon we're able to reduce the possibility of misunderstandings which

70
00:04:18,150 --> 00:04:19,120
often happens.

71
00:04:19,170 --> 00:04:25,020
And so the better our emails are the more clear they are the more likely we are to be efficient and

72
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:27,780
communicate well with our our colleagues.

73
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:28,130
OK.

74
00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:30,960
If you don't know what these things are it's not that important.

75
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:34,170
These are just basically things that he needs.

76
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:38,540
We're not going to worry too much about that then is giving him a little push.

77
00:04:38,610 --> 00:04:39,110
OK.

78
00:04:39,150 --> 00:04:44,250
He could just stop there and say thanks Alan but he's giving him a bit of push and he's trying to give

79
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:47,100
him a feeling of urgency.

80
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:48,600
Hurry up a little bit OK.

81
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,220
Don't go slowly on this.

82
00:04:50,280 --> 00:05:01,150
Get back to me A.S.A.P. as soon as possible with these estimates as soon as possible this is very common

83
00:05:01,150 --> 00:05:01,980
as well.

84
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:08,310
And often at the end of an email like this you'll have one sentence that is just pushing a little bit.

85
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:13,090
Please let me know as soon as you can or I'm really looking forward to hearing from you.

86
00:05:13,090 --> 00:05:16,060
There are a lot of sentences you can use like that.

87
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:18,930
We're going to go through a couple in just a minute.

88
00:05:18,970 --> 00:05:19,370
OK.

89
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:25,210
So you can use this structure basically this format when you're writing e-mails to your colleagues your

90
00:05:25,210 --> 00:05:31,330
co-workers and they will probably appreciate you for being so clear the structure is introduction to

91
00:05:31,330 --> 00:05:38,190
what I need or the situation specifically the things I need in a list set off by colon.

92
00:05:38,410 --> 00:05:42,170
Then a little push one sentence and then the name.

93
00:05:42,190 --> 00:05:43,890
OK thanks is enough.

94
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:44,920
Thanks is enough.

95
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:50,050
Could have said regards I guess thanks is probably better in this situation.
