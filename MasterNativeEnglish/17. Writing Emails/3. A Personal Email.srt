1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:00,470
OK.

2
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:04,610
So let's now go through a real example of a personal email.

3
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:12,540
We could also say a more casual e-mail we could say an informal e-mail between two friends we've got

4
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:20,470
Kate here and Sarah here and the situation is Kate is going to visit Sarah.

5
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:20,800
OK.

6
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:24,620
Kate is going to visit Sarah and now Sarah is going to write an email.

7
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:29,320
Her purpose is to figure out when actually Kate is going to arrive.

8
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:31,990
Specifically she wants to get this detail.

9
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:32,910
She wants to know that.

10
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:37,920
But she also wants to show her excitement.

11
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:44,490
So remember as we talked about earlier in this lesson the form of the e-mail the style should follow

12
00:00:44,490 --> 00:00:50,900
the purpose our purpose is to show excitement and also to figure out this one bit of information.

13
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:51,710
When.

14
00:00:51,850 --> 00:00:52,500
All right.

15
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:53,400
Pretty simple.

16
00:00:53,550 --> 00:01:00,300
We can then be a little bit more friendly and as I mentioned earlier I use the word flowery which basically

17
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:06,720
means we can be a little bit more relaxed about using words we can maybe use words we wouldn't use in

18
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:08,210
a professional email.

19
00:01:08,330 --> 00:01:13,260
And we don't have to worry too much about being super super concise.

20
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:13,580
All right.

21
00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:15,500
So we have a chunk here.

22
00:01:15,510 --> 00:01:18,380
This is let's call the main body and then the question here.

23
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:21,380
Remember we should separate out the main question.

24
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:23,690
That's what we're trying to get this information.

25
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:26,740
So we need to make sure it's not part of this.

26
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:33,780
Let's just read through it and see if we can get the feeling for why this is a good way to to write

27
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:34,880
an email to a friend.

28
00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:35,480
OK.

29
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:39,960
Dear Kate by the way we can also take dear out of there if we want to.

30
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:45,860
If we wanted to just say hey Kate or hello Kate or hi Kate or just Kate.

31
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:49,140
I'm really looking forward to your visit next week.

32
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:55,050
We can see a lot of interesting places and I can show you some restaurants to eat local food.

33
00:01:55,390 --> 00:01:59,360
OK maybe they're old friends and they haven't seen each other in a while.

34
00:01:59,370 --> 00:02:00,110
Who knows.

35
00:02:00,110 --> 00:02:00,330
OK.

36
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:02,820
So just an example just an example.

37
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:08,070
She's just saying some of the things that they might do when Kate visits.

38
00:02:08,070 --> 00:02:09,790
What's the purpose of that.

39
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:10,790
Why would she say that.

40
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:12,750
She's not giving any names.

41
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:14,830
She's not asking any questions.

42
00:02:14,850 --> 00:02:16,020
It's a waste of time.

43
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:19,200
Well this is really just to be polite.

44
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:22,230
It's also to show her excitement but also to be polite.

45
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:26,790
If she just starts the e-mail hi Kate which day do you think you will arrive.

46
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:32,920
It sounds like I have no other purpose or interest other than knowing exactly when you will be here.

47
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:38,190
And it feels very business like if we just say Kate which day do you think you will arrive.

48
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:44,890
So by saying this first we we make it feel more comfortable we can show a bit of emotion.

49
00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:48,330
She feels oh wow my friend Sarah can't wait to see me.

50
00:02:48,330 --> 00:02:54,900
She's very excited and now I can't wait to maybe see some local restaurants or hang out or do interesting

51
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:56,650
things in interesting places.

52
00:02:56,730 --> 00:02:57,430
So this is good.

53
00:02:57,450 --> 00:03:00,300
And it's actually important to have something there.

54
00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:04,320
You could ask a few questions instead you could say How are your kids doing.

55
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:04,750
You can.

56
00:03:04,770 --> 00:03:07,340
You can use things that you know about your friend.

57
00:03:07,350 --> 00:03:11,370
How are things going with the kids or how's your job in these days.

58
00:03:11,370 --> 00:03:18,330
I heard that you got a promotion so you can use information that you know to get information from them

59
00:03:18,510 --> 00:03:25,200
but you may just be doing that to be friendly so that you're not saying only exactly what your question

60
00:03:25,290 --> 00:03:25,730
is.

61
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:30,160
Because again if you do that sounds a bit unfriendly sounds a bit cold.

62
00:03:30,270 --> 00:03:32,880
And it sounds a bit to business like OK.

63
00:03:32,910 --> 00:03:34,550
So something has to be there.

64
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:39,120
I like to use usually some questions some questions.

65
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:42,450
I heard that you're going to be moving to Seattle in a few months.

66
00:03:42,450 --> 00:03:43,350
Is that true.

67
00:03:43,350 --> 00:03:47,820
If so let me know because I have some friends there who might be able to help you.

68
00:03:47,850 --> 00:03:53,430
That would be a very simple thing to put at the beginning of an email and then maybe I have a couple

69
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:55,760
of questions I'd like you to answer.

70
00:03:55,950 --> 00:04:01,830
Again this is someone I know someone who I'm friends with maybe I have a long relationship with this

71
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:02,530
person.

72
00:04:02,730 --> 00:04:06,300
If it's a stranger then I have nothing to ask like this.

73
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:13,560
We could still do an introduction or something but we wouldn't be able to say anything like that then

74
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:19,620
we say the purpose which day do you think you will arrive sounds a little bit softer than when will

75
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:20,720
you arrive.

76
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:23,350
That sounds a little too direct.

77
00:04:23,370 --> 00:04:24,750
It sounds a little too direct.

78
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:26,190
When are you coming to straight.

79
00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:28,060
When do you think you will arrive.

80
00:04:28,230 --> 00:04:29,250
When do you think.

81
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:31,480
Sounds much more gentle.

82
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:31,910
OK.

83
00:04:31,950 --> 00:04:33,420
Now she she uses.

84
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:39,290
See you at the end of the class will go over some more of these and different ones we can use.

85
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:41,100
See you is actually pretty good.

86
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:42,210
It's very friendly.

87
00:04:42,210 --> 00:04:43,350
It's very casual.

88
00:04:43,410 --> 00:04:45,480
And then she writes her name at the bottom.

89
00:04:45,630 --> 00:04:51,780
So in the personal style there can be many different ways to do it but it is important to have usually

90
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:56,790
something at the beginning of the email to give it its friendly tone.

91
00:04:56,790 --> 00:05:01,420
And we need to be clear that sometimes we can use dear but we don't have to.

92
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:07,540
And also the purpose what we're trying to get from the other person should be separate from the main

93
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:08,240
body.

94
00:05:08,290 --> 00:05:13,980
You can remember these things you should be able to write really clear personal emails anytime you need.
