1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:03,750
Just like in the email we saw between Allen and Steve.

2
00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:09,540
The sentence at the very end can serve as a little push and I want to go through just a couple more

3
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:11,310
of sentences like that.

4
00:00:11,310 --> 00:00:17,940
There are many many more possible sentences something you can put at the end to just offer a tiny nudge

5
00:00:18,030 --> 00:00:20,980
or maybe add a little extra information.

6
00:00:21,030 --> 00:00:27,630
Sometimes can be used to make a comment like I hope your parents are doing OK that's fine too.

7
00:00:27,670 --> 00:00:29,880
OK but this is for a professional email.

8
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:31,900
Looking forward to hearing from you.

9
00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:33,460
Looking forward to hearing from you.

10
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:37,140
Please let me know A.S.A.P. as soon as possible.

11
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:42,780
Let me know if you have any questions let me know if you have any questions send me these by Friday

12
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:45,860
if you can send me these by Friday if you can.

13
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:48,340
Or please send me these by Friday if you can.

14
00:00:48,630 --> 00:00:50,260
I'll follow up next week.

15
00:00:50,310 --> 00:00:51,870
I'll follow up next week.

16
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:58,410
That means I will contact you next week to make sure that what we discussed in this e-mail is happening.

17
00:00:58,410 --> 00:01:01,130
I'm going to make sure that everything is on track.

18
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:02,840
Keep me up to speed.

19
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:05,730
That means if something changes let me know.

20
00:01:05,730 --> 00:01:12,430
That basically means Keep me updated Keep me updated keep me up to date keep me up to speed.

21
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:20,190
Same thing sometimes we say keep me also in the loop in the loop is very common.

22
00:01:20,190 --> 00:01:22,790
Make sure to keep me in the loop keep me up to speed.

23
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:23,780
Keep me up to date.

24
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:25,740
These are all very very common.

25
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:26,380
OK.

26
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:31,210
And that really means send me updates when things change when things happen.

27
00:01:31,230 --> 00:01:32,340
I need to know.

28
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:32,700
OK.

29
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:34,650
These are more professional ones.

30
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:36,650
These are for more professional e-mails.

31
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:42,360
Then for more friendly ones we might say things like I hope everything is really good with your family.

32
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:48,330
A comment or a small question but I want to make sure you feel comfortable using these because they're

33
00:01:48,330 --> 00:01:51,190
very common for professional emails.

34
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:58,440
So we've gone through our tips for e-mails we've gone through examples of formal and informal emails.

35
00:01:58,470 --> 00:02:03,300
The last thing I want to do very quickly is just go over some things that are said at the end of an

36
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:10,360
email right before you write your name followed by a comma followed by a comma.

37
00:02:10,890 --> 00:02:11,880
These aren't all of them.

38
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:17,040
There are many many more I just want to give you a feeling for which ones are neutral which ones are

39
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:19,640
very professional formal which ones are very friendly.

40
00:02:19,670 --> 00:02:19,930
OK.

41
00:02:19,950 --> 00:02:21,470
Take care.

42
00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:23,120
But I should start with these two regards.

43
00:02:23,130 --> 00:02:24,080
Best regards.

44
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:24,810
OK.

45
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:27,450
This is pretty general use.

46
00:02:27,450 --> 00:02:31,110
Very let's say General or neutral.

47
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:33,000
You could use it in a professional situation.

48
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,110
You could use it with a friend could use it with a teacher.

49
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:36,750
Very useful.

50
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:37,920
Take care.

51
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:41,430
This is probably more personal sincerely.

52
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:45,720
Could be could be neutral but it's often more personal.

53
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:47,960
So it depends on the situation.

54
00:02:47,970 --> 00:02:50,660
Yours truly is definitely personal.

55
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:52,170
Very personal.

56
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:52,980
Cheers.

57
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:59,930
Could be pretty neutral could be pretty neutral so cheers is often for maybe a colleague a co-worker

58
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:05,240
or if you're writing a quick e-mail to somebody you maybe are in touch with regularly.

59
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:09,010
Thanks is pretty general pretty general pretty neutral.

60
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:10,200
You could use that one.

61
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:11,790
This is very personal.

62
00:03:11,790 --> 00:03:13,290
Love is very personal.

63
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:20,160
Take it easy is let's say very friendly but you could use it in a professional situation if you need

64
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:20,480
to.

65
00:03:20,490 --> 00:03:23,810
It's very friendly but very relaxed.

66
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:26,730
It's not too formal but you could use it professionally.

67
00:03:26,730 --> 00:03:29,520
Have a good one is the same as take it easy.

68
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:37,740
It's pretty friendly but could be used neutrally for a friend or for a colleague or a co-worker later

69
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:44,700
is definitely very casual very casual very relaxed you wouldn't probably use that with a colleague unless

70
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:51,000
you knew them really really well and see you is not really used that often in e-mail.

71
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:57,450
It might be used just as a text message or a message to a friend but see you is often pretty personal

72
00:03:57,570 --> 00:03:58,470
pretty personal.

73
00:03:58,470 --> 00:04:02,400
I just wanted to give you a quick feeling for them and some examples.

74
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:09,030
There are many many more I would recommend just looking them up on the Internet finding a list and looking

75
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:13,410
at some examples maybe of emails to see how they're used.

76
00:04:13,410 --> 00:04:17,310
Of course the best way to get good at something is to practice it.

77
00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:23,070
So what I'd like you to do is practice writing either a business or formal email review it carefully

78
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:27,080
to ensure that tone and style fit your purpose.

79
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:32,010
Make sure it fits the purpose and also make sure that your punctuation is perfect.

80
00:04:32,010 --> 00:04:33,150
It's got to be perfect.

81
00:04:33,150 --> 00:04:34,140
Try a few.

82
00:04:34,230 --> 00:04:36,240
Write a personal one and a professional one.

83
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:39,920
If you have time get feedback from people you know send it to a friend.

84
00:04:39,930 --> 00:04:41,310
Have them look at it for you.

85
00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:46,740
And as I mentioned use something like grammar Lee to check your punctuation check your spelling and

86
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:48,750
check your basic grammar.

87
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:49,070
OK.

88
00:04:49,110 --> 00:04:49,560
Good luck.
