1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:05,640
Now before we get started with the actual practice for this lesson let's just go over some some basic

2
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:06,690
vocabulary.

3
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:09,750
I think you probably know one or two of these words before.

4
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:17,520
We've talked certainly a little bit about variation but a variation is basically a another version of

5
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:18,430
the same thing.

6
00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:24,570
If you do a variation of something that means you do it again in a slightly different way whether it's

7
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:31,050
a painting or maybe a dish you're cooking whatever it happens to be a variation means you've taken that

8
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:35,870
thing and you're going to try to do that same thing but make a couple of small changes.

9
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:39,240
So you've made a variation of that.

10
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:45,270
And if we have many of those we can say many variations that will make more sense a little bit later

11
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:47,940
in this lesson with what we're going to do next.

12
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:52,690
OK now liberties Well you might know the word liberty means freedom.

13
00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:53,110
OK.

14
00:00:53,130 --> 00:00:56,980
Liberties can mean the plural form of freedom.

15
00:00:57,090 --> 00:01:03,030
But when I say in this case take liberties we often hear say take liberties.

16
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:08,760
That means don't restrict yourself too much to one specific thing.

17
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:14,550
So if you take some creative liberties for example when you're doing a variation of a painting maybe

18
00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:20,680
you're trying to paint a painting similar to a famous painting.

19
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:21,290
OK.

20
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:26,330
And you might add I don't know an extra flower or you might add some different colors.

21
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,100
That would be taking liberties.

22
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:33,870
That means just following your following your heart I guess taking some freedom to do what you want

23
00:01:33,870 --> 00:01:36,210
to do to do what feels right.

24
00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:36,450
OK.

25
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:37,380
So that's OK.

26
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:39,310
That's what we call taking liberties.

27
00:01:39,330 --> 00:01:44,640
And when we do today's lesson and the exercises that we're going to talk about today we need to remember

28
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:50,850
that it's OK to take liberties sometimes taking liberties or doing what we feel might be interesting

29
00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:58,740
is a good way to explore new types of grammar or explore how we use words it might be also a good way

30
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:04,740
to maybe find new uses of for example vocabulary.

31
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:06,420
So it actually can be really useful.

32
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:06,830
All right.

33
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:12,480
Now improvisation and we'll talk a little bit more about this at the end or toward the end of the lesson.

34
00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:22,140
The short version of this is often improv I and P R O V improv and improv is often related to comedy.

35
00:02:22,170 --> 00:02:26,880
So you might see improv comedy which means that nothing is planned.

36
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:31,470
Maybe there's a situation maybe there is a scene but nobody knows what's going to happen.

37
00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:34,320
There's no script there's no dialogue.

38
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,880
So you'll see maybe an improv comedy show.

39
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:39,980
It's very funny because nobody knows what's going to happen.

40
00:02:39,990 --> 00:02:42,210
And it's kind of crazy.

41
00:02:42,690 --> 00:02:49,470
Improvisation is this ability to be able to speak naturally and continuously without really thinking

42
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:51,520
carefully about what you're saying.

43
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:54,940
And we're going to practice that later on in the lesson.

44
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:59,940
So I hope these three words are clear and let's go on to our first exercise.
