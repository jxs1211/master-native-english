1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:07,290
So we've talked about now an exercise that can help us think about syntax how we organize our sentences

2
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:13,140
how we can fit words that we know together into a coherent story.

3
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:20,010
Now this exercise the simplification exercise is all about forcing ourselves to find the simple way

4
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:21,310
to explain something.

5
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:26,600
In fact much of natural English especially natural spoken English is quite simple.

6
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:28,880
People often speak very simply.

7
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:34,230
So when you look at something that's written down and you say Wow it's very long and complicated it

8
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:40,610
is certainly possible and even likely that that can be actually said in a much simpler way.

9
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:42,090
We're going to do that now.

10
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:42,780
OK.

11
00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:49,190
Now the one we're going to look at is not actually very good but you could also do this for literature

12
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:53,520
for example if you read a page of a book that's kind of complicated.

13
00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:59,190
You can take that paragraph from that book and simplify it boil it down.

14
00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:06,410
We often when we talk about simplifying things we talk about boiling it down to its simplest form.

15
00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:07,940
So let's play around with this.

16
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:09,000
And this is really play.

17
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,960
I consider this to be play.

18
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:15,980
The more you can play with English and play with language the more comfortable that you'll be.

19
00:01:16,050 --> 00:01:20,100
And then you're going to be more creative when you want to express your ideas and speak.

20
00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:24,090
You're going to be able to express yourself creatively simply and clearly.

21
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:24,640
OK.

22
00:01:24,690 --> 00:01:28,190
So it was Christmas I spent the day with my family.

23
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:31,500
We opened presence together and made a big meal.

24
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:32,900
The meal was delicious.

25
00:01:32,910 --> 00:01:34,620
We had a great day together.

26
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:36,480
Christmas is my favorite holiday.

27
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:40,020
So this is filled with a lot of redundant language.

28
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:41,490
Something is redundant.

29
00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:43,650
That means it's really doesn't need to be said.

30
00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:44,010
OK.

31
00:01:44,010 --> 00:01:46,790
So how do we eat a big meal.

32
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:48,360
The meal was delicious.

33
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:50,430
OK we said meal twice.

34
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:51,840
That's not so good.

35
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,910
Christmas is my favorite holiday.

36
00:01:53,910 --> 00:01:59,400
Well if we're talking about how great Christmas is do we need to say that it's our favorite.

37
00:01:59,410 --> 00:01:59,660
OK.

38
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:01,050
I spent the day with my family.

39
00:02:01,050 --> 00:02:03,920
We opened presents together and had a big meal.

40
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:09,060
It just sounds a little weird because the sentences are maybe too short.

41
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:10,770
The syntax is not great.

42
00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:13,230
And there's a bit of repetition in words.

43
00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:17,400
A bit of redundancy so stop the lesson here.

44
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:23,120
Try your own try to try three different ones and see what you can come up with.

45
00:02:23,130 --> 00:02:33,000
I'm going to try to variations to simplifications of the original text and see how close your eyes are

46
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,900
to mine if they're not like mine.

47
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:36,300
That's totally ok.

48
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:38,720
There are many ways to do this.

49
00:02:38,730 --> 00:02:45,760
Just see how well you can do it and then come back.

50
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,060
All right here we go.

51
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:48,500
My first one.

52
00:02:48,530 --> 00:02:48,920
Let's see.

53
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:56,650
My family my family and I had a great time.

54
00:02:56,690 --> 00:03:05,150
Opening presents together on Christmas after a big delicious meal.

55
00:03:05,510 --> 00:03:07,470
Wow you've said pretty much everything there.

56
00:03:07,490 --> 00:03:09,460
My family and I had a great time.

57
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:13,700
Opening presents together on Christmas after a big delicious meal.

58
00:03:13,790 --> 00:03:18,640
One sentence and we've said pretty much everything that's been said here.

59
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:24,950
And so we've removed a lot of the redundancy and it's very clear even though it's a lot simpler I would

60
00:03:24,950 --> 00:03:28,160
say this is way better than the original.

61
00:03:28,190 --> 00:03:29,690
Way way better.

62
00:03:29,690 --> 00:03:32,840
OK then we could add maybe four four syntax.

63
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:34,470
We can add one sentence.

64
00:03:34,490 --> 00:03:36,370
It's my favorite holiday.

65
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:38,060
Christmas is my favorite holiday.

66
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:44,220
So you have this very long sentence that says everything we want to say and then it's my favorite holiday.

67
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:49,710
A very simple sentence to give us some variation in our sentence style.

68
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:55,550
And if it's not there I think it's OK because we can kind of get a feeling that it's it's your favorite

69
00:03:55,550 --> 00:03:56,150
holiday.

70
00:03:56,150 --> 00:04:02,690
It's actually not my favorite holiday by the way my favorite holiday is a very silly holiday that my

71
00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:07,500
family and I invented which we call Hanks giving.

72
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:09,200
I just write that down.

73
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:10,650
It's a ridiculous thing.

74
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:11,750
We invented it.

75
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:15,320
It's called Hanks giving not Thanksgiving.

76
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:17,800
So there's an American holiday called Thanksgiving.

77
00:04:17,810 --> 00:04:20,120
Well we celebrate one called Hanks giving.

78
00:04:20,150 --> 00:04:24,170
And if you know there's a famous actor his name is Tom Hanks.

79
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:25,940
So on Hanks giving.

80
00:04:26,510 --> 00:04:28,750
We get our friends together my family and I.

81
00:04:28,790 --> 00:04:31,340
And we watch Tom Hanks movies.

82
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:34,620
We play games Tom Hanks related games.

83
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:36,020
We have trivia.

84
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:37,840
It's very weird.

85
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:40,850
It's very strange but we have a lot of fun.

86
00:04:40,850 --> 00:04:42,740
It's quite interesting.

87
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:44,210
It's quite interesting.

88
00:04:44,210 --> 00:04:49,710
Hanks giving something that only my family does it's not normal for sure.

89
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:50,170
OK.

90
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:57,710
So let's try one more of these and see if we can do another interesting variation variation.

91
00:04:57,740 --> 00:04:58,990
OK here we go.

92
00:04:59,230 --> 00:05:07,780
I spent I spent I spent this Christmas with my family and we'll just make that a simple sentence.

93
00:05:07,790 --> 00:05:11,360
I don't want to say that long sentence equals good sentence.

94
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:12,400
That's not true.

95
00:05:12,470 --> 00:05:21,320
So you can have short sentences long sentences they can all be good sentences after a huge tasty meal.

96
00:05:21,350 --> 00:05:26,210
We all had a great time opening presence together.

97
00:05:26,210 --> 00:05:31,400
So now this one is a bit different because the sentences are about the same length but I would say it's

98
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:34,730
no better or worse than the other one the first one we did.

99
00:05:34,730 --> 00:05:36,170
Now where could we put.

100
00:05:36,230 --> 00:05:37,420
It's my favorite holiday.

101
00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:43,940
If we want to put that in so we could put my favorite holiday at the end but we could also use which

102
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:53,000
I spent this Christmas comma which is my favorite holiday comma with my family.

103
00:05:53,090 --> 00:05:54,070
We could do that.

104
00:05:54,080 --> 00:06:00,360
That is something that you can do to add information to a sentence and it's really really useful.

105
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:02,040
You can do it with people.

106
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:03,740
You can do it with things.

107
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:09,870
If it's a thing then usually you use which if it's a person you'll use who.

108
00:06:09,890 --> 00:06:15,140
I'll just give you a very quick example of how to do that just so you know so that you can use it in

109
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:16,100
the future.

110
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:18,170
Let's make two short sentences.

111
00:06:18,170 --> 00:06:22,110
My uncle is a doctor.

112
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:26,360
My uncle lives in Canada.

113
00:06:26,810 --> 00:06:27,300
OK.

114
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,540
To have two sentences this and this.

115
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:30,730
These two are the same.

116
00:06:30,770 --> 00:06:37,460
So we don't want to say both of those we can replace this with who or which person my uncle.

117
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:39,860
So we should say who not which.

118
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:40,290
OK.

119
00:06:40,310 --> 00:06:41,680
So here's what we do.

120
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:51,140
We take this one and we put it right there and then we add comma Hu comma or comma which comma very

121
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:59,990
simple we could do it the other way to my uncle comma who is a doctor comma can if it's a thing we would

122
00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:07,280
just say which there is my favorite holiday lives in Canada we change nothing about this sentence or

123
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:14,270
this sentence we just take this sentence and into the other sentence using who or which if it's a thing

124
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:21,020
we could go the other way we could say my uncle who lives in Canada is a doctor this is so easy.

125
00:07:21,050 --> 00:07:27,440
So whenever you want to add information you can use this general grammar structure it allows you to

126
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:34,460
put in things about a person or a thing in a way which really you don't have to think much about and

127
00:07:34,670 --> 00:07:36,860
when when should we put lives in Canada.

128
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:38,510
Inside is a doctor.

129
00:07:38,510 --> 00:07:41,000
When should we do that instead of the other way.

130
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,880
Well I would say the main sentence is probably more important.

131
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:49,720
So my Cole lives in Canada is probably the most important thing we want to say.

132
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:51,670
My uncle who is a doctor.

133
00:07:51,670 --> 00:07:58,780
That's just extra information so I usually put the extra information inside the two commas.

134
00:07:58,790 --> 00:07:59,640
It's called a comma.

135
00:07:59,650 --> 00:08:07,210
By the way a do you put the extra information there and then the main sentence is usually the more important

136
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:07,980
thing.

137
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:14,590
So these two exercises completing sentences by taking out key words from an article and then making

138
00:08:14,590 --> 00:08:21,190
a story stitching them together and then simplifying a paragraph from an article or a novel or whatever

139
00:08:21,370 --> 00:08:24,490
and doing several simplified variations of that.

140
00:08:24,550 --> 00:08:30,910
These are two powerful ways to get you to think more creatively in English and the more you do it the

141
00:08:30,910 --> 00:08:35,860
more powerful you're going to feel when you get into a situation you need to express yourself.

142
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:40,900
You're going to be able to put your words together a little bit more easily and that's going to allow

143
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:47,620
you to come across or speak more naturally you'll find your words more easily and you'll be able to

144
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:50,690
stick them together without really thinking about it.

145
00:08:50,710 --> 00:08:54,910
If you practice this enough practice is extremely important.

146
00:08:54,940 --> 00:09:00,300
You've got knowledge but you also need to practice it you've got to build the right habits.

147
00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:04,060
Gotta get comfortable in English you've got to do exercises.

148
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:05,680
So for an assignment.

149
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:12,820
Here are a couple of examples of very very short words that you can fit together into a sentence or

150
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:13,960
a couple sentences.

151
00:09:13,990 --> 00:09:15,070
Very simple.

152
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:15,230
OK.

153
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:22,060
Now once you've done these and you feel like it's pretty easy go a step further get an article from

154
00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:29,440
the newspaper or a book or whatever and do the exercises that we learned in this lesson do them several

155
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:35,940
times when you choose one to do for simplification try 10 variations if you can.

156
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:42,470
I want to emphasize it's very important to play play and having fun with it making it funny right.

157
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:43,750
Doing it a little differently.

158
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:48,410
Changing the style especially for the second one is really really important.

159
00:09:48,410 --> 00:09:52,900
English can be actually a lot of fun if you jump in and swim around.

160
00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:54,350
So go practice.

161
00:09:54,350 --> 00:09:54,770
Good luck.
