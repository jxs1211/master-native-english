1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:00,570
All right.

2
00:00:00,590 --> 00:00:06,960
So we've done variations and you can use that exercise anytime to improve your English skills.

3
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:14,010
Now we're going to go onto an exercise that I designed specifically to improve your ability to think

4
00:00:14,010 --> 00:00:15,000
in English.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:21,060
Now if you've already seen this in my other course about learning to think in English the English brain

6
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:22,740
course then I'm sorry.

7
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:27,660
I want to cover it in this course because I think it's so important and a lot of students have told

8
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:29,990
me how useful it is to them.

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,490
So I want to make sure that we included in this course so that you can use it to actually start thinking

10
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:38,210
in English thinking in English is very important.

11
00:00:38,220 --> 00:00:43,770
If you can start thinking in English then you can start speaking in English more naturally.

12
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:46,870
You don't have to translate in your head.

13
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:47,340
All right.

14
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:48,620
So this is very simple.

15
00:00:48,630 --> 00:00:50,340
Let me explain how we do it.

16
00:00:50,490 --> 00:00:50,750
All right.

17
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:58,260
So the forward exercise is going to force us to use English very flexibly very creatively.

18
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:01,120
We have no choice but to think in English to do this.

19
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:03,340
Choose four words.

20
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:06,720
And once you get good you can use five maybe six.

21
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:09,810
And I recommend using different forms of words.

22
00:01:09,870 --> 00:01:13,090
So don't use only verbs maybe use a verb.

23
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:14,310
Use an adjective.

24
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:17,300
Use another verb use a noun different types.

25
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:24,550
And it's good if you choose words that can have many different forms like cooler coolest cool right.

26
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:26,700
Because cool has different meanings too.

27
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:27,270
That's good.

28
00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:29,550
Don't put each word into its own sentence.

29
00:01:29,550 --> 00:01:32,270
They all have to be in one sentence.

30
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:34,920
You can move them around in any order you like.

31
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:36,740
Doesn't matter what order they're in.

32
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:37,800
That's fine.

33
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:42,010
In fact you should be moving them around and trying them in different ways.

34
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:44,670
You can explore the different meanings of each word.

35
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:48,090
As I mentioned cool means like you're or you're an awesome person.

36
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:49,810
And it also means kind of cold.

37
00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:50,450
OK.

38
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:52,820
But also you can change the forms.

39
00:01:52,830 --> 00:01:56,340
So for example think we can say thankful.

40
00:01:56,350 --> 00:01:57,250
Thanks.

41
00:01:57,300 --> 00:02:00,120
There are lots of different forms of words as well.

42
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:06,960
So one sentence not two sentences very important that you make it fit in one sentence that forces you

43
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,040
to be very creative.

44
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:08,780
OK.

45
00:02:08,790 --> 00:02:11,550
Any order any form.

46
00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:14,190
Now I've decided to use for this one.

47
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:19,200
We're going to use communicate and turn and fool and cost.

48
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:23,880
And honestly when I was working on this class plan I just chose four words.

49
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:26,040
I chose the first four words I thought of.

50
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:28,280
There's nothing special about these words.

51
00:02:28,290 --> 00:02:31,660
If you want to change them and choose different words you should.

52
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:38,640
And all you have to do to do this exercise is sit down write forwards down and then see how many different

53
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:43,280
sentences you can come up with and how many different meanings you can come up with.

54
00:02:43,290 --> 00:02:48,540
Let's look at two ways that we can use communicate turn fool and cost.

55
00:02:48,570 --> 00:02:54,700
I'm going to give two examples but there are many many other ways we can use these words to make a sentence.

56
00:02:54,780 --> 00:03:00,850
Just before we do let me go over a couple of the different forms so we could have communicate.

57
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:02,520
We could have communication.

58
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:04,340
We could have communicator right.

59
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:09,260
We could have a couple of different forms of communicate turn turning turns.

60
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:09,680
OK.

61
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:11,170
Those are OK.

62
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:14,370
Fool foolish Fool are fools.

63
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:14,870
OK.

64
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:18,510
We can use those cost costs sometimes costing.

65
00:03:18,510 --> 00:03:18,810
OK.

66
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:22,320
So let's let's look at a couple of examples sentences.

67
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:26,410
Number one the cost of a failure to communicate.

68
00:03:26,490 --> 00:03:32,350
Whose turn it is to speak might result in someone looking foolish.

69
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:32,670
OK.

70
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:36,810
So we have communicate in its original form the one we have here.

71
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:40,590
This turn doesn't mean turn left or right but in order.

72
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:42,150
Whose turn is it.

73
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:42,960
It's my turn.

74
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:50,640
OK then we have foolish foolish which is one form of the word fool and we have cost in its original

75
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:51,150
form.

76
00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:51,590
OK.

77
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:54,910
Let's see if we can come up with one which is very different.

78
00:03:55,110 --> 00:04:04,440
Next one I foolishly turned onto the wrong road because of miscommunication and it cost me a job.

79
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:06,240
So do we have cost.

80
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:06,940
Yes.

81
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:10,310
This one we've used the verb form miscommunication.

82
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:10,970
Well OK.

83
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:15,220
That's a form of communicate miscommunication is a noun.

84
00:04:15,290 --> 00:04:15,510
OK.

85
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:17,620
We've used it as a noun full.

86
00:04:17,730 --> 00:04:20,270
We've used foolishly foolishly.

87
00:04:20,270 --> 00:04:28,350
This is an adverb used an adverb foolishly turned and turned in the past tense past past tense we've

88
00:04:28,350 --> 00:04:29,250
used turned.

89
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:32,790
So we've got all four of our words full cost turn and communicate.

90
00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:35,610
But we've used them very differently than the previous one.

91
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:37,620
And we could keep going.

92
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:43,610
I don't want to bore you with many many examples but I hope this gets the idea across.

93
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:49,260
Nothing special about the words you have to force yourself to stick with the rules follow the rules

94
00:04:49,290 --> 00:04:50,890
no more than one sentence.

95
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:57,000
Once you get good at it try five words try six words and it's very important that it actually makes

96
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:57,330
sense.

97
00:04:57,330 --> 00:04:59,400
It can't just fit together.

98
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:02,580
Dramatic and you say all the grammar is right.

99
00:05:02,590 --> 00:05:04,400
It also has to make sense.

100
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:06,460
It has to be logical.

101
00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:11,650
It has to be something that you could hear in a story if it's grammatically correct and you've just

102
00:05:11,650 --> 00:05:12,310
got a bunch of.

103
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:15,220
And then and then and then and then.

104
00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:16,850
And the sentence is this long.

105
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:18,170
You failed.

106
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:21,690
It's got to be a nice neat clean sentence.

107
00:05:21,690 --> 00:05:22,340
OK.

108
00:05:22,510 --> 00:05:23,920
You've got to follow the rules.
