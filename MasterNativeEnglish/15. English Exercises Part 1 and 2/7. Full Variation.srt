1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:05,940
So our first exercise will be something similar to what we did in the previous lesson but a bit different

2
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:08,540
because this is a full variation.

3
00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:15,150
We looked before it how we could say things a little bit differently and also reduce the redundancy

4
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:19,370
and any repetition that we could cut out to make it simpler.

5
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:23,850
Well we can do the same thing but just go for a full variation.

6
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:29,250
In other words we can take some creative liberties we can do what we want but it has to stay in the

7
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:35,340
general area and the events pretty much have to be the same although maybe we can do it from a different

8
00:00:35,540 --> 00:00:36,650
a different perspective.

9
00:00:36,810 --> 00:00:42,270
But basically what we're going to do is rewrite the whole thing and you can do this with a maybe two

10
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:45,120
paragraphs from a book that you're reading.

11
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:49,500
You might try to do it with a big paragraph from an article that you're reading.

12
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:55,800
Whatever as long as it's something that's long enough and has enough detail so that you can really explore

13
00:00:55,800 --> 00:01:03,030
it and do a really good variation or rephrase it can also say that we're rephrasing it and now we're

14
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:07,540
going to look at a short story very short story and see if we can rephrase it.

15
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:09,530
So let's just read through this.

16
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:13,650
Something unusual happened as Alex made his way home from class.

17
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:19,470
He had been walking through campus when suddenly a stranger wearing a black mask holding a small knife

18
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:25,070
stepped out from behind a tree and demanded that Alex hand over his wallet.

19
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:31,350
Of course Alex valued his life more than his money and it seemed like the mugger meant business.

20
00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:37,830
But as he was taking out his wallet the stranger lowered the knife and said You're a coward before running

21
00:01:37,830 --> 00:01:40,120
away into the darkness.

22
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:42,710
OK now I think you can probably get the idea.

23
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:46,050
The meaning of that story wallet is where you keep your money.

24
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:49,490
The mugger is the person who may steal your money on the street.

25
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:51,150
They'll say Hey give me your wallet.

26
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:55,330
That is a mugger and to mean business means that you're not joking around.

27
00:01:55,410 --> 00:01:56,760
It's serious.

28
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:58,110
You really intend to.

29
00:01:58,110 --> 00:02:02,280
If you don't give me your wallet I will stab you with this knife.

30
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:02,550
All right.

31
00:02:02,550 --> 00:02:05,380
Now I've written a variation of this.

32
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:10,940
I've basically taken this story which I also wrote and I wrote it again in a different way.

33
00:02:11,010 --> 00:02:14,070
And I've written it from the perspective of the mugger.

34
00:02:14,130 --> 00:02:17,130
So that is a creative liberty that I have taken.

35
00:02:17,130 --> 00:02:23,250
So what you can do is try to write it from different perspectives in different ways and really explore

36
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:24,200
the event.

37
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:26,670
It's a very good creative exercise.

38
00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:26,940
OK.

39
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:29,060
Now let's look at my variation of this.

40
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:36,510
And notice that it's from the perspective of Alex's friend who I've decided is the one who was mugging

41
00:02:36,510 --> 00:02:37,010
Alex.

42
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:38,460
It was fake.

43
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:41,750
He was just playing a joke on his friend his roommate.

44
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:43,040
He wanted to scare him.

45
00:02:43,050 --> 00:02:44,620
That's why he said You're a coward.

46
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:49,920
In my mind OK so I'm writing it from his perspective Alex's roommate played a horrible prank on him

47
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:50,750
last night.

48
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:54,330
He put on a ski mask and hid behind a tree until dark.

49
00:02:54,510 --> 00:02:58,740
Then when he spotted Alex walking back to the dorm he jumped out.

50
00:02:58,740 --> 00:03:03,480
He realized he might be taking things a little far with the pocket knife in his hand.

51
00:03:03,630 --> 00:03:09,420
But Alex is petrified face made it all worthwhile just to see what would happen.

52
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:13,800
He demanded Alex's wallet feeling the joke had gone far enough.

53
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:18,300
He said You're a coward before disappearing into the shadows.

54
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:21,080
He laughed all the way back to the dorm.

55
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:21,520
OK.

56
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:25,080
So basically it's the same story two different perspectives.

57
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:26,280
You get the idea.

58
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:34,440
The point is exploring within the constraints or the limits of the original story and the events that

59
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:36,590
happen so keep the events the same.

60
00:03:36,590 --> 00:03:38,490
Keep the basic story the same.

61
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:44,460
Explore what's possible within that play with the language tell a couple of versions of it doesn't have

62
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:50,100
to be from another perspective but it's a great exercise if you want to be a better writer and it's

63
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:57,300
a great exercise to help you think in English a little bit differently and develop your basic habits

64
00:03:57,450 --> 00:04:01,120
and and your skills in how you put sentences together.

65
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:02,570
So you practice this a lot.

66
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:07,020
You're going to get really good at that and you're gonna become a much better writer as well because

67
00:04:07,050 --> 00:04:09,530
each version should be better than the last.

68
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:13,040
And then you can go back and look at it and see how can I improve.

69
00:04:13,050 --> 00:04:13,550
OK.

70
00:04:13,650 --> 00:04:18,330
So that is the sentence variation or the rephrasing exercise.

71
00:04:18,330 --> 00:04:22,170
Now let's go on and do another one which is also really really useful.
