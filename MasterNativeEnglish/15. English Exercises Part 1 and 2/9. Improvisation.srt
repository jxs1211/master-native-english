1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:02,640
We've done the variation exercise.

2
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:04,420
The forward exercise.

3
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:07,110
Now we're going to do improvisation.

4
00:00:07,110 --> 00:00:11,640
Remember I told you improvisation means that you speak without thinking.

5
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:12,780
This is very important.

6
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:19,590
If you want to get used to that feeling of speaking freely in conversation without feeling like where

7
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:21,630
are my words I can't find my words.

8
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:27,460
Well you probably can't find your words because you're not used to finding them in conversation.

9
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:29,580
And it's as simple as that.

10
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:32,320
You have to do something in order to be good at it.

11
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:40,590
So in the improvisation exercise you need to speak continuously cannot right this one speak continuously.

12
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:44,720
Write down a word and then whatever that reminds you of.

13
00:00:44,790 --> 00:00:51,770
Start talking about it and then go and go for about a minute maybe two minutes if you can just talk.

14
00:00:51,990 --> 00:00:53,150
Doesn't have to be perfect.

15
00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:54,750
It's not going to be perfect.

16
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:56,310
I'm going to do it in a moment.

17
00:00:56,310 --> 00:00:58,180
It's not going to be perfect.

18
00:00:58,210 --> 00:01:03,150
I'm probably going to say some things that sound a little I don't know silly maybe I don't know.

19
00:01:03,150 --> 00:01:06,390
I don't know what I'm going to say it's going to be improvisation.

20
00:01:07,010 --> 00:01:07,340
OK.

21
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:10,330
So this is an extremely important exercise.

22
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:12,420
Always record it.

23
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:15,360
Pushed the record button on your phone whatever.

24
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:19,770
Just make sure it's recorded so that you can listen back to it and see how you did.

25
00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:20,200
OK.

26
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:23,260
So choose a word that has some meaning in your life.

27
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:29,320
Don't choose a word like of or in doesn't have much meaning inside of it.

28
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:31,990
Choose a word like wild life.

29
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:33,780
And I'm just going to start speaking.

30
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:36,470
I promise you I have not planned this OK.

31
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:40,110
And I'm going to use the first take of this.

32
00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:44,430
That means I'm not going to cut this and try many many tries.

33
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:46,700
I want you to get a feeling for the real one.

34
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:48,220
This is my first attempt.

35
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:53,120
I'm only going to record this one time and I'm going to talk about wildlife.

36
00:01:53,130 --> 00:01:54,050
You can do the same thing.

37
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:56,460
Use wildlife or use another word.

38
00:01:56,550 --> 00:02:02,600
Choose a word like marriage or a word like literature or dentistry.

39
00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:06,720
I like to use subjects because you can talk about those things and connect it to your life.

40
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:07,380
So here we go.

41
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:14,620
So when I grew up I was basically raised to know how to make things.

42
00:02:14,730 --> 00:02:21,810
And that's because I was raised in the countryside so I would often go out into the woods and I would

43
00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:27,430
make forts and I would make tree houses and I would like to find things in the river.

44
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:32,670
And it gave me a real appreciation for nature and for wildlife.

45
00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:40,590
And I think that's one of the reasons why I really care so much about making sure that human activities

46
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:45,330
don't have a negative effect on nature and on wildlife.

47
00:02:45,330 --> 00:02:52,460
So take for example the animals in Africa which are endangered because of poaching there.

48
00:02:52,490 --> 00:03:00,180
There are many people who who want for whatever reason certain things certain products that can be made

49
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:06,630
from animals like elephant tusks and because there are people who will pay money for that because there

50
00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:12,750
are people who will buy that they then are supporting an economy where a poacher is a person who hunts

51
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:20,550
or kills animals like elephants illegally will will kill an elephant to get its tusks and it's causing

52
00:03:20,550 --> 00:03:22,380
these animals to be endangered.

53
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:29,130
So I think because of my my childhood in nature and studying animals watching animals and playing outside

54
00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:33,890
I think I have a deep appreciation and I think a lot of other people do too.

55
00:03:33,990 --> 00:03:40,590
And I think that really we have to do something and take action in order to to actually protect animals

56
00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:45,070
especially animals and plants to be honest which are endangered.

57
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:52,410
So let's take elephants I mean elephants are being killed very often in Africa and there are some people

58
00:03:52,410 --> 00:03:54,990
who actually do do things to protect them.

59
00:03:54,990 --> 00:03:56,320
Sharks as well.

60
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:59,660
There are things that can be done to protect these animals.

61
00:03:59,670 --> 00:04:07,380
One of the things that I think is probably good for anybody to do is donate to organizations who are

62
00:04:07,470 --> 00:04:09,930
actually fighting illegal poaching.

63
00:04:09,930 --> 00:04:17,100
And just by donating to those organizations they can then bring on more people and get to know the maybe

64
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:23,250
local culture so that they can try to have a real impact because if the elephants are gone like the

65
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:27,410
rhino is gone now one of the rhino species is gone.

66
00:04:27,530 --> 00:04:33,270
Then what's the point of being alive if we don't have animals to appreciate.

67
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:34,040
OK.

68
00:04:34,170 --> 00:04:35,160
I'm going to stop there.

69
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:37,400
So that was me just going.

70
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:39,260
I didn't have anything in mind.

71
00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:40,890
I didn't have anything planned.

72
00:04:40,950 --> 00:04:47,070
Just talking and maybe I repeated myself a few times when you don't have a clear structure when you

73
00:04:47,070 --> 00:04:48,390
don't have an outline.

74
00:04:48,450 --> 00:04:50,910
It tends to happen when you're in conversation with friends.

75
00:04:50,910 --> 00:04:56,860
It's very easy to kind of repeat yourself or focus on something too much or whatever.

76
00:04:56,860 --> 00:04:59,370
That's not the point of this exercise.

77
00:04:59,370 --> 00:05:06,200
The point of this exercise is for you to get used to the feeling of speaking freely without stopping

78
00:05:06,470 --> 00:05:11,420
so that when you need to have those conversations when you need to explain yourself you feel comfortable

79
00:05:11,510 --> 00:05:13,010
and confident to do so.

80
00:05:13,010 --> 00:05:21,830
So try the exercise where you do variations try the forward exercise and try the improvisation exercise

81
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,140
and for that one.

82
00:05:23,150 --> 00:05:24,460
Make sure you speak.

83
00:05:24,470 --> 00:05:27,700
Make sure you record so that you can listen to it again.

84
00:05:27,830 --> 00:05:29,600
So to practice this.

85
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:32,300
Number one for the forward exercise.

86
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:33,610
Start with these four.

87
00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:38,080
And then once you've done these for a few times try your own.

88
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:44,900
Write down your own four words go to five go to six then for the improv exercise.

89
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:48,690
You can try these two fake products and parenting.

90
00:05:48,730 --> 00:05:53,600
OK just two topics you can use but then after that pick your own topics.

91
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:54,530
It's not hard.

92
00:05:54,530 --> 00:05:57,640
Just choose anything and talk about it for the other one.

93
00:05:57,650 --> 00:06:04,430
The variation all you have to do is find a paragraph from a story find a paragraph from an article for

94
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:07,590
example and make variations of that.

95
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:09,580
See how many different ways you can say it.

96
00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:10,670
All right.

97
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:18,380
Good luck and I hope that these exercises help to improve your ability to think in English and also

98
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:21,890
improve your speaking habits.

99
00:06:21,890 --> 00:06:22,310
Good luck.
