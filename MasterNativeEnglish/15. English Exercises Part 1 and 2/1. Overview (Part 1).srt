00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:09,690
In the last lesson we talked about the future how to talk about things we would like to do things that

2
00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:15,390
will happen different levels of certainty and in this course we've been really focused on different

3
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:18,830
situations and different topics different specific skills.

4
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:24,570
But I want to in this lesson and the next lesson focus on some things you can do on a daily basis to

5
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:30,660
practice so that your mind can develop the habits that it needs to develop so that you can build the

6
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:34,070
right habits to become a good English speaker.

7
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:40,800
I think this course wouldn't be complete unless you had the correct habits not only the knowledge that

8
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:43,920
you need but the correct habits to be able to speak clearly.

9
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:51,720
So we're going to go over some exercises some things that you can do on a regular basis on a daily basis

10
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:55,920
to practice all of the things that we're learning in this course.

11
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:00,200
Some things you can do to build the correct habits.

12
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:03,990
Habits are so important when it comes to speaking a language.

13
00:01:03,990 --> 00:01:09,390
If you know everything but you don't have the right habits then the things that you know won't help

14
00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:14,290
you a lot when it comes to speaking saying what you want to say.

15
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:17,840
So I want to make it very clear that you need to learn all that stuff.

16
00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:22,800
You need to know all that stuff but then you've got to have the right way of thinking and you've got

17
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:28,800
to have the right habits and the right way of thinking is the first step toward becoming a better speaker

18
00:01:28,830 --> 00:01:32,500
and having those good speaking habits.

19
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:39,480
OK so doing a little bit of practice every day little exercises can help develop your your mind so that

20
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:44,280
you feel comfortable when you want to say something when you want to use the things that we're learning

21
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:45,830
in this course.

22
00:01:45,870 --> 00:01:53,070
So we're going to go over for some basic words a few things you need to know then we'll get into some

23
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:55,690
specific exercises that we can do.

24
00:01:55,710 --> 00:02:00,720
We're going to talk about one called that I call stitching and I'll show you what that means in a second

25
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:06,540
but basically stitching is linking things together creatively and then we're gonna go into something

26
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:07,890
called simplification.

27
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:12,900
So we need to understand what we've seen what we've read so that we can simplify it in a way which is

28
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:18,990
really natural and find out where the things that are unnatural or maybe redundant are.

29
00:02:18,990 --> 00:02:22,080
We'll go into that when we get into each exercise.

30
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:23,150
So let's get started.
