1
00:00:03,930 --> 00:00:11,070
In the last lesson we talked about some exercises you can do to improve your spoken English and also

2
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:13,970
improve your habits when you're speaking English.

3
00:00:14,010 --> 00:00:16,500
In this lesson we're going to do more of the same.

4
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:22,320
We're going to look at a couple of exercises and I should mention that a couple of these have been covered

5
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:25,770
in my other course called building your English brain.

6
00:00:25,770 --> 00:00:32,310
So if you want to see more things like this then make sure to sign up for that course as well.

7
00:00:32,310 --> 00:00:39,780
But these are just things that you can do to improve habits and it's less about actually learning words

8
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:46,530
and phrases and learning about how to handle situations which is what most of this course is about.

9
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:51,600
So let's actually go through what we're going to talk about in this lesson we're going to talk about

10
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:53,490
some basic vocabulary.

11
00:00:53,490 --> 00:01:00,210
I'm going to teach you a few words then we're going to do some exercises about rephrasing.

12
00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:03,150
Now we've done something similar in the last lesson.

13
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:03,900
It's a bit different.

14
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:08,430
And then we're going to do an exercise called the forward exercise.

15
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:12,510
We're going to practice that I'm going to show you how you can do it anytime you like.

16
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:17,670
And then we're also going to do something called improvisation which I will explain when we get to that

17
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:18,250
part.

18
00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:19,850
So let's get started.
