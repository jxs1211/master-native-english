1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:05,850
So let's just go over a few words that you will need to know in order to really understand the basic

2
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:11,460
ideas behind what we're going to try to accomplish or achieve in this.

3
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:14,100
In this lesson first simplification.

4
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:22,440
So if you hear somebody say something or you read a book or you watch a movie whenever you talk about

5
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:26,760
that thing often you're simplifying what you heard.

6
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:30,770
Reducing it so that you can communicate it clearly to others.

7
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:35,730
So simplification means to take something and make it simpler.

8
00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:41,040
This is a simplification if you know something about science that most people don't know and you need

9
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:48,270
to explain it to someone you have to be able to simplify it or make a simplification in order to explain

10
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:48,770
it.

11
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:54,240
If you read a book and you want to express it you need to be able to simplify maybe some of the ideas

12
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:58,710
to explain it to a good friend who might not know much about that topic.

13
00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:04,350
So we're going to try to do this in the second exercise but I just want to make sure you're familiar

14
00:01:04,350 --> 00:01:06,030
with the word simplification.

15
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:14,340
It's connected to the word simplify which is a verb simplification is a noun and it comes from also

16
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:20,160
simple and simple is an adjective of course whoops a D.J. as I usually write it as a D.J..

17
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:21,020
OK.

18
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:26,940
Now clarity is also something we have to think about when we're expressing ideas or simplifying something

19
00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:28,330
or explaining something.

20
00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:35,550
So if you have an idea which is very complicated and you want to communicate it it's very easy to say

21
00:01:35,550 --> 00:01:41,370
it in a way which makes other people feel more confused because it's a complicated idea or if you're

22
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:44,910
telling a story it's easy to mix up the details.

23
00:01:44,910 --> 00:01:50,700
And when you actually say all of the things you want to say it comes out as all sort of messy and mixed

24
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:50,850
up.

25
00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:52,930
So we have to focus on clarity.

26
00:01:53,010 --> 00:01:57,380
Clarity means that when we speak when we write whatever we do.

27
00:01:57,450 --> 00:02:04,770
Communication wise we have to try to say things in a way that can not be misunderstood.

28
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:14,730
The purpose of language is communication and clarity means that things are very clear very easy to understand.

29
00:02:14,910 --> 00:02:17,100
Now the verb for this is clarify.

30
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:22,170
So if you have a bunch of people and everybody's arguing and fighting and the reason is because they

31
00:02:22,170 --> 00:02:27,390
don't really understand what they're talking about and you really do you could say Excuse me.

32
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:30,770
Let me let me clarify this issue for you.

33
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:33,840
Let me try to make it simple and clear and easy to understand.

34
00:02:33,990 --> 00:02:38,270
So we also have to try to bring some clarity to what we're saying.

35
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:45,570
Always focus on trying to be simple trying to clarify things good English is not necessarily very complicated

36
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:53,040
often natural English is very simple in fact and good communicators know how to speak clearly.

37
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:57,200
Next is syntax so syntax is an interesting idea.

38
00:02:57,210 --> 00:03:03,420
We often think of syntax as related to writing but actually syntax is basically the different kinds

39
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:05,580
of sentences that we choose.

40
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:12,210
So if you always begin sentences in the same way or you always maintain or keep the same basic sentence

41
00:03:12,210 --> 00:03:16,870
structure and you get into the habit of using maybe it was too much.

42
00:03:16,890 --> 00:03:22,330
That's just an example whatever it is people will begin to sort of lose interest.

43
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:29,010
So it's also important to understand how to say things in different ways use different types of sentence

44
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:35,730
structures begin sentences in different ways so that when you speak people are interested and they don't

45
00:03:35,730 --> 00:03:36,510
get bored.

46
00:03:36,590 --> 00:03:39,710
It's actually very important to have some variation.

47
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:45,450
And when we say good syntax we're usually looking at writing and saying oh there are some some longer

48
00:03:45,450 --> 00:03:51,210
sentences some shorter sentences some different types of sentences to say the same type of thing.

49
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:57,480
So this shows that you understand English and know how to use it well enough so that when people read

50
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:03,240
what you write or listen to what you say they are fully interested because it's always kind of different

51
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:05,280
and changing its dynamic.

52
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:06,600
This is a good word to use.

53
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:09,880
I like this word dynamic dynamic dynamic.

54
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:10,650
OK.

55
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:12,580
The last word is merge.

56
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:16,710
So one thing we're going to do today is we're going to take some some words and we're going to try to

57
00:04:17,010 --> 00:04:24,000
bring them together into a single sentence we're going to try to merge them into full sentences merge

58
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,890
means to bring them together of two big companies come together you merge them.

59
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:34,740
If there's a big highway and a road that comes up to the highway and you enter onto the highway you

60
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:36,840
merge onto the highway.

61
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:41,560
So it basically means to bring together or to become part of something else.

62
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:48,360
So we're going to be doing an exercise where we stitch or merge merge different things together into

63
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:52,140
single sentences and you'll see what I mean in a moment.

64
00:04:52,170 --> 00:04:55,860
So I hope these four words are clear and I hope you can keep them in mind.
