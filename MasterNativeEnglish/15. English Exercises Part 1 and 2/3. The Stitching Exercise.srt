1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:06,300
Now this is an exercise that I call stitching stitching means again to bring things together like you're

2
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:08,190
sewing like you're sewing clothes.

3
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:12,390
So when we stitch things together we're trying to combine them.

4
00:00:12,390 --> 00:00:14,430
We're trying to merge them together.

5
00:00:14,430 --> 00:00:21,470
The reason we do this exercise is to understand ideas and then link them together in a way that is coherent.

6
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:23,200
That means it all makes sense.

7
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:30,000
Now this might seem a little bit like the sort of fill in the blank exercises or exams that you did

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,510
in middle school or high school and I guess it kind of is except you don't know where the blanks are.

9
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:40,270
And so it's kind of a more advanced version of fill in the blanks.

10
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:42,450
We've got a continuous story here.

11
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:46,080
The rules are that you can't really change the order.

12
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:50,430
You can only insert or put in other words.

13
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:52,040
That's the only thing you can do.

14
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:58,050
So what you can do to practice this on your own is basically maybe look at an article or a book and

15
00:00:58,050 --> 00:01:03,180
pick out some of the key words write them down in order like I've done here.

16
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:10,020
This is one that I've I've written myself and then write down or speak if you want to speak that's OK.

17
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:11,300
The whole thing.

18
00:01:11,370 --> 00:01:16,530
Don't look at the original do it in your own way fit it together in a way that makes sense to you but

19
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:21,690
force yourself to keep everything in order and you can make as many sentences as you want.

20
00:01:21,690 --> 00:01:24,780
So now we're going back to the idea of syntax.

21
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:30,900
We can put things together in creative ways depending on what makes the most sense or maybe what's the

22
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:31,770
most interesting.

23
00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:33,240
So let's actually try this one.

24
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:35,110
Let's do this together again.

25
00:01:35,190 --> 00:01:40,550
We're going to be basically just building sentences and putting them together as we like.

26
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:46,440
So I've written them like this just because it's I think easier to see each separate word I've capitalized.

27
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:49,070
Each word doesn't have to be capitalized.

28
00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:53,430
I put a period I put a period after each each word.

29
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:57,600
Again that doesn't have to be there it's just a way to to organize this.

30
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,550
So let's let's start.

31
00:01:59,550 --> 00:02:00,660
How do we begin this.

32
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:03,510
So we're starting with the time we're starting with a month.

33
00:02:03,510 --> 00:02:08,780
So let's just begin in in August and you can do this along with me.

34
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:12,870
And there's not only one right answer but we're going to try to make it fit together we're gonna make

35
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:14,930
it make sense in August.

36
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:18,760
I'm I'm going I'm going on.

37
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:22,850
OK so we could just say going on a trip but I'd like to make it a little more interesting.

38
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:25,460
So I'm going to I'm going to change it up a little bit.

39
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:32,200
Going on a solo add an additive there solo trip solo means by yourself.

40
00:02:32,210 --> 00:02:32,580
OK.

41
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:35,010
So a little trip to to Australia.

42
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:35,490
OK.

43
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:37,080
Simple enough first sentence.

44
00:02:37,170 --> 00:02:39,240
Very simple but we fit it together.

45
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:41,020
We could do it in a different way though.

46
00:02:41,110 --> 00:02:41,390
OK.

47
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:44,430
We could say next August we could start.

48
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:49,200
We probably couldn't put it in the past tense because of what's going to be there later.

49
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,480
But we could change it around a lot.

50
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:57,330
And you can play with it to get a feeling for how to link these these different words together.

51
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:58,130
OK.

52
00:02:58,130 --> 00:03:00,600
Then we start let's see next week buy tickets.

53
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:01,640
That's an easy one.

54
00:03:01,650 --> 00:03:12,540
Next week I need to make my I'm going to add make my itinerary make my itinerary temporary is your travel

55
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:13,910
travel plan.

56
00:03:13,930 --> 00:03:16,860
Make my itinerary and we're gonna have buy tickets there too.

57
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:23,320
So we can add a lot of things if we want between words and bye by my.

58
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:27,440
Well if we just say tickets then it could be train tickets so I want to make sure it's clear.

59
00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:30,170
So my plane tickets.

60
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:33,060
Now we have here my very close to my.

61
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:34,770
Is it is it OK that we do that.

62
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:35,040
Yeah.

63
00:03:35,130 --> 00:03:36,800
So it's OK that we do that.

64
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:43,980
We could also probably make our own sentence here if we wanted to with the last part we could say I

65
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:47,310
will also buy my plane tickets.

66
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:49,250
That would be another small sentence.

67
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:49,760
That's OK.

68
00:03:49,770 --> 00:03:52,030
To both of these are ok ok.

69
00:03:52,050 --> 00:03:53,600
So let's keep going with this.

70
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:54,520
I.

71
00:03:54,720 --> 00:04:05,010
I plan to to visit Sydney first and then head to Melbourne so we could say that at many many different

72
00:04:05,010 --> 00:04:05,370
ways.

73
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:07,650
Go to Melbourne and travel to Melbourne.

74
00:04:07,710 --> 00:04:14,790
I plan to visit Sydney and then Melbourne in many many different ways we could say this one as well.

75
00:04:14,790 --> 00:04:15,210
All right.

76
00:04:15,210 --> 00:04:15,990
Let's keep going.

77
00:04:16,020 --> 00:04:16,760
Let's keep going.

78
00:04:16,770 --> 00:04:19,870
Again I hope you're doing this as we go along with me.

79
00:04:19,890 --> 00:04:22,570
And if you're doing it differently from me that is fine.

80
00:04:22,590 --> 00:04:23,700
That is fine.

81
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:24,060
All right.

82
00:04:24,090 --> 00:04:25,660
Let's see what's next.

83
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:34,380
As soon as that means exactly when as soon as I arrive at my hotel and check in.

84
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:43,290
All I want to do is find a place to relax by the ocean.

85
00:04:43,290 --> 00:04:43,770
OK.

86
00:04:43,890 --> 00:04:44,850
Very simple.

87
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:51,090
But what made this all one sentence and we've added some interesting stuff between the words we have

88
00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:51,820
to use.

89
00:04:51,990 --> 00:04:54,160
We have to use hotel right.

90
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:55,730
We have to use arrive.

91
00:04:55,770 --> 00:04:58,160
We have to use relax.

92
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:59,590
We have to use ocean.

93
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:02,420
But Queen that we can do really what we want.

94
00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:04,660
We can add more we can add less.

95
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:07,050
Again you could make it a much longer story.

96
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:08,790
If you want to let's keep going.

97
00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:10,940
I'm gonna add something that's not here at all.

98
00:05:10,950 --> 00:05:20,220
That's what that's that's what they occasions are all about.

99
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:23,310
That's what vacations are all about.

100
00:05:23,310 --> 00:05:24,180
Woo hoo.

101
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:25,770
Add an exclamation there.

102
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:27,950
It's called an exclamation.

103
00:05:28,110 --> 00:05:29,230
I really hope.

104
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:30,150
And really why not.

105
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:31,100
We have to use hope.

106
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:37,470
And really I really hope I can meet a lot of Oh that's so weird.

107
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:42,390
Oh a lot of interesting people while I'm there.

108
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:49,110
Again we could say in Australia we could say there we could say while I'm on my trip we could say all

109
00:05:49,110 --> 00:05:53,670
of these things but the most important is that we are working within our rules.

110
00:05:53,670 --> 00:05:55,600
We have our clear rules right.

111
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:57,960
We've got do we have interesting people.

112
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:59,500
Yes interesting people is here.

113
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:00,270
Do we have hope.

114
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:02,940
First yes hope is right there.

115
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:08,430
And because those are the only two we're going to include here we have a lot more freedom can express

116
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:10,190
something very interesting.

117
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:12,820
Now the last part the last part.

118
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:13,290
Here we go.

119
00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:22,620
Last part at here we kind of have to say at it could say around the beginning of September but you probably

120
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:29,330
at at the beginning could say in the beginning as well at the beginning of September.

121
00:06:29,350 --> 00:06:34,780
Hope you don't mind if I just write S E P T at the beginning of September.

122
00:06:34,830 --> 00:06:42,140
I need to fly back home and return to work.

123
00:06:42,150 --> 00:06:45,020
We could also say get back to work.

124
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:47,780
I need to fly back home and get back to work.

125
00:06:47,790 --> 00:06:51,260
If we say back to times in a row it can sound a little bit weird.

126
00:06:51,270 --> 00:06:56,310
So I think return to work would be better if we took out back then maybe it would be OK and we could

127
00:06:56,310 --> 00:06:59,100
say I need to fly home and get back to work.

128
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:00,450
That would be just fine.

129
00:07:00,450 --> 00:07:03,860
So you've got to play around with this if you want to do it on your own.

130
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:07,410
All you do is find a text an article whatever.

131
00:07:07,470 --> 00:07:09,600
Pick out some of the keywords from there.

132
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:14,430
Write them down on a piece of paper in the correct order.

133
00:07:14,550 --> 00:07:19,630
You can write it just like this with the single word followed by a period just to make it simple.

134
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:26,670
Then at the bottom underneath that write your own little story and fill in the spaces and you want to

135
00:07:26,670 --> 00:07:29,470
try to make sure that it all makes sense.

136
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:35,160
You want to have different types of sentences different lengths different types of grammar that you're

137
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:39,240
using in the sentences and very importantly you want to make it interesting.

138
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:40,350
It's got to be interesting.

139
00:07:40,350 --> 00:07:46,770
OK let's go on and look at the next exercise that we can do which is similar to this but we're going

140
00:07:46,770 --> 00:07:51,390
to be actually simplifying and removing some things that are unnecessary.
