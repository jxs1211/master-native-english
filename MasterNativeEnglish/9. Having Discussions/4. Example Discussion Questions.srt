1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:04,700
So on this topic of how to have discussions we've talked about some techniques.

2
00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:09,430
Then we looked at some phrases we can use to actually start these questions.

3
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:12,410
And again those are not the only phrases we can use.

4
00:00:12,410 --> 00:00:14,170
There are just some examples.

5
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:16,010
There are many variations.

6
00:00:16,050 --> 00:00:18,210
Different ways of asking these questions.

7
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:24,260
Now let's actually look at some real examples so that we can get a feeling about how to do this.

8
00:00:24,270 --> 00:00:26,670
Our topic is something I care very much about.

9
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:31,220
Street food vendors street food being not so clean sometimes.

10
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:34,110
But the problem is it's very delicious.

11
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:37,860
So I always want to eat it but I think maybe I can't.

12
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:39,740
It's not very clean.

13
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:44,780
So we could ask some questions if we're going to have a discussion about this.

14
00:00:44,790 --> 00:00:48,190
I'm always having discussions about this with friends.

15
00:00:48,250 --> 00:00:50,200
OK what do you think.

16
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:55,260
What do you think could be done to ensure ensure means make sure.

17
00:00:55,260 --> 00:01:00,750
What do you think could be done to ensure that street food vendors again these are people selling food

18
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:06,990
on the street that street food vendors are selling clean food and following food safety rules.

19
00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:09,620
What do you think could be done.

20
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:11,420
Sort of like saying what could we do.

21
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:18,570
What could people do that basic question that I've mentioned before now we're getting somebody's idea

22
00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:21,500
about how to solve this problem.

23
00:01:21,510 --> 00:01:22,910
Give me some solutions.

24
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:24,060
Give me some ideas.

25
00:01:24,220 --> 00:01:30,150
Well we could have an app or we could make sure that people have a Yelp sticker or something like that

26
00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:36,060
with a QR code that people could scan or we need to keep street food vendors in certain areas so that

27
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:40,850
the whatever blah blah blah blah blah people can give their ideas.

28
00:01:40,870 --> 00:01:42,290
OK let's look at another one.

29
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:45,990
What are the best local snacks and street foods in your city.

30
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:46,230
OK.

31
00:01:46,230 --> 00:01:51,980
So this is related to street food vendors in a very direct way just talking about your favorite things.

32
00:01:52,050 --> 00:01:54,460
Everybody likes to talk about their favorite things.

33
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:59,310
So what are your favorite street foods if you don't have any in your city maybe you've been to a city

34
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:00,600
and you could talk about that.

35
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:02,270
Oh well there's a blah blah blah.

36
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:09,840
And in this city I could talk for an hour about this one if you were going to open a falafel stand falafel

37
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:12,500
is how food falafel.

38
00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:16,000
Maybe maybe Middle Eastern food.

39
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:17,190
I like falafel.

40
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:19,860
I'm not sure if there are any stands that sell just falafel.

41
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:26,970
Maybe I just like falafel so much that I call them falafel stands even though they actually sell other

42
00:02:26,970 --> 00:02:28,500
stuff too.

43
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:33,840
If you were going to open up a falafel stand in New York City NYC is New York City.

44
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:34,680
That's where I live.

45
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:39,250
So I used this example and wanted to stand out.

46
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:41,010
That means you want people to notice you.

47
00:02:41,010 --> 00:02:44,160
You want people to go Oh what's that.

48
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:46,280
How would you market your stand.

49
00:02:46,350 --> 00:02:49,020
Stand is your where you sell right.

50
00:02:49,050 --> 00:02:50,660
Sometimes it's called a cart.

51
00:02:50,730 --> 00:02:55,160
Sometimes it's called a stand sometimes in New York it's called a truck.

52
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:55,570
OK.

53
00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:57,750
How would you marketed how would you promote.

54
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59,240
How would you get others to know.

55
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:01,110
How would you advertise.

56
00:03:01,410 --> 00:03:05,150
So you would use maybe you would talk about social media.

57
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:08,640
Talk about videos talk about how you would spend money.

58
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:10,830
Talk about discounts and coupons.

59
00:03:10,830 --> 00:03:18,210
I don't know whatever you would do to get people to come to your falafel truck or your falafel stand.

60
00:03:18,270 --> 00:03:19,710
And it's just an example.

61
00:03:19,710 --> 00:03:20,010
Right.

62
00:03:20,010 --> 00:03:21,790
But it's an interesting question.

63
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:27,000
What do you think about the idea of making food carts illegal.

64
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,390
Now someone could just say I don't like the idea bad idea.

65
00:03:30,390 --> 00:03:31,670
That's a simple answer right.

66
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:35,870
But then you have to say well why why do you think it's a bad idea.

67
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,380
Then they have to explain.

68
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:42,750
So it's OK to answer this question in a simple way and then follow with why.

69
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:50,280
So hopefully this has given you a pretty clear idea about how we can explore or talk about a main topic

70
00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:57,390
and then ideas related to it and use different ways to ask questions that are interesting about interesting

71
00:03:57,390 --> 00:04:02,170
ideas that make the other person feel I have something to say.

72
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:06,600
This is an interesting question because you're asking me for my opinion.

73
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:09,440
You're asking me to explain something about my life.

74
00:04:09,450 --> 00:04:13,120
You're asking me to talk not just asking me for information.

75
00:04:13,290 --> 00:04:13,890
OK.

76
00:04:13,890 --> 00:04:14,880
Keep that in mind.

77
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:17,220
And let's let's look at an assignment.

78
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:19,250
You can do to practice this.

79
00:04:19,350 --> 00:04:26,350
So you should have now a very good idea about how to ask these questions from the last lesson.

80
00:04:26,490 --> 00:04:28,080
How to start a conversation.

81
00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:33,080
And now here's how to ask good questions that can make other people want to talk with you.

82
00:04:33,090 --> 00:04:34,980
So I'd like you to practice it.

83
00:04:35,010 --> 00:04:40,800
What I'd like you to do is look at this topic famous people who have dropped out of college that means

84
00:04:41,190 --> 00:04:49,200
they've quit college or they quit college for example Mark Zuckerberg Steve Jobs and Bill Gates all

85
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:52,830
of these three very famous people left university.

86
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:53,530
They QUIT.

87
00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:59,990
They come up with three interesting questions around this topic using some of the phrases that we learned

88
00:04:59,990 --> 00:05:03,760
in this lesson and then to test it.

89
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:11,150
I would like you to ask yourself the questions and answer the questions give the answer to the question

90
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:13,190
and record yourself doing that.

91
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:16,850
Or have the discussion with a friend ask a friend the questions.

92
00:05:17,090 --> 00:05:18,410
If they go.

93
00:05:19,490 --> 00:05:20,530
I don't know.

94
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:22,700
Or if they say Oh yeah.

95
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:24,090
The answer is blah blah blah.

96
00:05:24,230 --> 00:05:29,720
And then it feels like it's hard to move the conversation forward and keep going.

97
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:33,150
Probably a problem with your questions.

98
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:41,930
So to do this well remember your goal is to get the other person's brain to turn move get the juices

99
00:05:41,930 --> 00:05:45,460
flowing we say get the juices flowing.

100
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:46,110
All right.

101
00:05:46,370 --> 00:05:46,750
Good luck.
