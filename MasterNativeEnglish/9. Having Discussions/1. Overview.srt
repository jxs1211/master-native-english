00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:11,280
In the last lesson we talked about how you can start conversations in situations where you maybe don't

2
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,590
know other people but you have something in common.

3
00:00:15,810 --> 00:00:21,630
And it's just a casual conversation perhaps free talk in this lesson.

4
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:27,350
It's related in this lesson we're going to talk about how you can have discussions.

5
00:00:27,470 --> 00:00:28,800
But what's the difference.

6
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:31,430
Well starting a conversation is how to get it going.

7
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:33,150
What's the first thing you say.

8
00:00:33,230 --> 00:00:33,500
Right.

9
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:39,920
But how to have discussions is for many more situations when you're with friends.

10
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:45,990
When you're with someone who you really want to talk to and maybe you'll sit down with a cup of coffee

11
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:49,390
and talk to them for a while for an hour.

12
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:52,530
How do you have a good conversation.

13
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:59,010
There are good discussions and bad discussions and I'm sure that you know what a good discussion feels

14
00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:06,010
like and what a bad discussion feels like a good discussion means there's back and forth right.

15
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:08,310
It's not only one person talking.

16
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:09,880
Both people are talking.

17
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:12,100
Both people are listening.

18
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:14,250
Both people are giving opinions.

19
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:17,240
Ideally both people are asking questions.

20
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:22,800
So in this lesson we're going to talk about how you can keep a discussion going and how you can find

21
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:29,700
the interesting points around a topic related to a topic within a topic how you can find those things

22
00:01:29,730 --> 00:01:35,050
and use them to explore deeply a topic.

23
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:38,480
To do this we need to be able to think abstractly.

24
00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:43,830
That means we need to be able to think about a topic in a very general sort of way so that we can then

25
00:01:43,830 --> 00:01:51,270
pick out those interesting things that can then be used to make questions that can then make the other

26
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:53,990
person think wow that's a good question.

27
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,170
I have a lot to say.

28
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:59,910
So let's actually get started with how we can do this in English.
