1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:04,110
So there are really two things that you need to keep in mind when you're doing this.

2
00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:10,690
One is you need to think around the topic and two as you need to be able to ask open questions.

3
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:13,280
Not every question is a good question.

4
00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:17,250
You have to know that First not every question is a good question.

5
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:23,820
If your goal is a good conversation and you can test that by asking those questions and seeing if other

6
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:30,670
people have a lot to say so let's first talk about what some bad questions might be for discussion.

7
00:00:30,690 --> 00:00:34,720
So let's say we're talking about smoking in public.

8
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:38,790
This is something people talk about in America.

9
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:43,970
There are a lot of rules about smoking in public where it can be done where it can't be done.

10
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:46,760
And these conversations happen.

11
00:00:46,850 --> 00:00:48,510
But let's look at a bad question.

12
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:52,940
If we're having a good discussion there are good questions and bad questions.

13
00:00:53,010 --> 00:01:00,710
A bad question might be when did smoking first become banned in your city.

14
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:06,030
So this is a when question and the answer to this when questioned by the way banned means it became

15
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:07,180
illegal.

16
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:13,300
The answer to this ban question doesn't really matter to the conversation let's say it's 1998.

17
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:15,120
What can you say after that.

18
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:18,570
When did smoking become banned in your city.

19
00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:26,100
Well either the answer is I don't know or I know it's 1998 with either answer Do you really feel like

20
00:01:26,190 --> 00:01:28,220
OK now I have something to say.

21
00:01:28,410 --> 00:01:36,570
No this is not a very good question at all because it doesn't make the other person think of anything.

22
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:39,140
It doesn't make them want to share an opinion.

23
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:47,100
Instead we should focus on saying something that makes the other person want to give their opinion.

24
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:51,510
Because when someone asks for your opinion you probably have a lot to say.

25
00:01:51,510 --> 00:02:00,960
Another example of a bad question is a very basic yes no question like Is Is smoking allowed at the

26
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:01,770
airport.

27
00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:03,520
It's either yes or it's no.

28
00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:10,740
So we have to be very careful about yes no questions because sometimes yes no questions are just conversation

29
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:15,340
Enders they sort of end the conversation or they make it hard to continue.

30
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,840
Now sometimes yes no questions work.

31
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:24,300
If you said for example do you think smoking should be allowed at airports then someone could say no

32
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:25,090
I don't.

33
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:27,260
And then you could say why.

34
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:33,250
So asking a do you think question can be really good as long as you follow up with why.

35
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:37,610
And then you get there thinking the other person's thinking behind the issue.

36
00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:38,040
OK.

37
00:02:38,130 --> 00:02:45,390
So I think we've made it clear that asking for basic information a fact asking someone to tell you a

38
00:02:45,390 --> 00:02:52,140
fact about something that they may or may not know or asking them to answer a very very basic yes no

39
00:02:52,140 --> 00:03:00,630
question that these are bad ideas when it comes to actually communicating with another person and having

40
00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:02,150
a good discussion.

41
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:03,750
Nothing wrong with those questions.

42
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:05,800
If you're looking for the answers.

43
00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:11,970
But when you have a discussion you're not looking for the answers really you're looking to engage with

44
00:03:11,970 --> 00:03:14,810
another person to connect with another person.

45
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:23,810
So we want to keep our questions open asking how questions asking why questions.

46
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:27,380
We'll look at some more examples of the types of questions that we can ask.

47
00:03:27,390 --> 00:03:30,310
But these are more open questions.

48
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:36,930
But we also have to think around the topics I want to talk about what that really means to think around

49
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:37,790
a topic.

50
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:41,960
Think about a topic as something at the center.

51
00:03:41,970 --> 00:03:43,860
So this is at the center.

52
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:50,080
OK here's here's this thing at the center and this is our topic which is smoking in public.

53
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:50,890
OK.

54
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:56,730
What are the things that are related to this connected to this in some way.

55
00:03:56,730 --> 00:04:04,140
We have to now be able to think in the abstract to think abstractly Well we could directly ask questions

56
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:06,390
about smoking in public.

57
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:12,360
We could also ask questions about addiction ups HDD addiction right.

58
00:04:12,390 --> 00:04:16,620
We could talk about how people are addicted to smoking we could talk about.

59
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:21,870
We could talk about peer pressure peer pressure is the idea that because all of my friends do something

60
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:27,660
I do something and that might be related to why is it that more men smoke than women.

61
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:31,910
Why is it that in some countries smoking is very popular but in others it isn't.

62
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:38,580
We could talk about maybe we could talk about hypotheticals and this is where we just sort of imagine

63
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:46,590
a situation that may or may not be true let's say for example that in the future medicine is so good

64
00:04:46,710 --> 00:04:51,710
that it's impossible for you to die from heart disease or cancer.

65
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:55,680
Does that mean that we should no longer think about smoking.

66
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:59,430
What do you think the future would be like in regards to smoking.

67
00:04:59,890 --> 00:05:05,800
If we didn't have to worry about heart disease or cancer would smoking still be popular or not.

68
00:05:05,890 --> 00:05:07,900
And then you could ask why is that OK.

69
00:05:07,910 --> 00:05:12,970
So this is maybe an interesting question we could ask lots of these sorts of hypothetical interesting

70
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:21,550
imaginary questions in imaginary situations related to the topic of smoking or health or even addiction

71
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:22,630
or peer pressure.

72
00:05:22,810 --> 00:05:28,570
Maybe another related topic connected to this is about public spaces.

73
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:32,790
How much control should the government have over public spaces.

74
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:37,450
Should the government be able to control everything about what is done in a public space.

75
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:40,720
We could of course we could talk about health risks.

76
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:45,610
Now this one you have to be a little bit careful about because if you just say to the other person could

77
00:05:45,610 --> 00:05:50,190
you please tell me the risks involved with maybe smoking.

78
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:52,540
Well it's a little bit obvious right.

79
00:05:52,570 --> 00:05:59,100
If you ask someone to tell you what risks are involved with smoking it's kind of just a list of things

80
00:05:59,110 --> 00:06:00,370
well you could get cancer.

81
00:06:00,370 --> 00:06:02,030
Well you could get heart disease.

82
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:03,160
Well you could get this.

83
00:06:03,170 --> 00:06:08,500
Well you could get this and then you're just asking people to know something and then they're just basically

84
00:06:08,530 --> 00:06:13,200
telling you the list of things that they know is that really a discussion.

85
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:19,430
Again focus more on on opinions focus more on getting somebodies idea.

86
00:06:19,450 --> 00:06:22,520
Focus more on getting solutions to problems.

87
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:22,870
Right.

88
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:28,780
So if we're talking about the health risks maybe they're obvious but maybe we focus on one specific

89
00:06:28,780 --> 00:06:34,480
thing maybe we focus on the health risks related to a mother's right.

90
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:35,770
Pregnant women.

91
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:41,290
And how could we have a space for people to smoke and at the same time make sure that pregnant women

92
00:06:41,890 --> 00:06:48,220
are not exposed to what we call second hand second hand smoke.

93
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:49,910
Right now we're looking for solutions.

94
00:06:49,930 --> 00:06:56,020
When you ask somebody to give you a good idea about how to solve something a lot of the time people

95
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:58,750
will be very interested to share their idea.

96
00:06:58,870 --> 00:07:04,900
So all of these things are kind of connected to this idea of smoking in public but they're not exactly

97
00:07:04,990 --> 00:07:07,430
only the topic of smoking in public.

98
00:07:07,450 --> 00:07:12,230
So I just want to give you this thought before we really look at some examples.

99
00:07:12,310 --> 00:07:17,890
When you want to have a discussion keep the questions open and your main focus should be to get the

100
00:07:17,890 --> 00:07:20,790
other person thinking about something to give an opinion.

101
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:27,720
To give a solution to give an idea to consider something that's hypothetical which means not real.

102
00:07:27,970 --> 00:07:35,350
And also don't just stay on that one thing look directly around it in the abstract and think about what

103
00:07:35,470 --> 00:07:44,500
ideas are related to that topic or that discussion point or whatever it is and then use those related

104
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:49,880
ideas or the topic itself to ask those really interesting questions.

105
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:55,260
If you get good at this everyone will want to have conversations with you.

106
00:07:55,360 --> 00:08:02,320
If you get good at asking good questions then other people will really want to communicate with you

107
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:07,090
and share their ideas with you and we'll respect you when you're having a discussion it's not about

108
00:08:07,270 --> 00:08:09,380
I'll say my opinion you say your opinion.

109
00:08:09,490 --> 00:08:15,970
It's about listening to what other people say and thinking about how to ask them a great question that

110
00:08:16,030 --> 00:08:19,000
opens up a completely new idea.

111
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:25,330
Whenever I have discussions with people I always try to focus on the questions instead of just giving

112
00:08:25,330 --> 00:08:29,750
my opinions because I find the questions and the answers to those questions.

113
00:08:29,770 --> 00:08:36,130
If they're good questions allows me to understand another person more and maybe maybe get a new idea

114
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:38,050
that I never thought about before.
