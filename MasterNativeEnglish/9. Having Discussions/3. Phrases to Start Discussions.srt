00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:06,540
So far in this lesson we've been talking about the techniques that we need to have really good discussions.

2
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:12,140
Now we need to look at actually some phrases that we can use to ask these questions.

3
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:13,730
So let's let's look at these.

4
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:18,090
This is a basic one but we could just say what do you think are the basic reasons.

5
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:20,880
What do you think are the most important reasons.

6
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:23,420
What do you think are the best ways.

7
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:28,080
All of these things are ways to get somebodies mind moving.

8
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:34,170
Why do you think the Internet but other than that whatever the topic is OK you're just getting their

9
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:34,560
ideas.

10
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:38,700
So what do you think are what do you think is and why do you think.

11
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:43,470
How could people or how could we you could use other things there.

12
00:00:43,470 --> 00:00:45,050
You don't have to use people.

13
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:48,330
This one how could people how could you How could I.

14
00:00:48,330 --> 00:00:49,300
How could we.

15
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:55,070
Is a way to get somebody to give you a possible solution a possible answer to a problem.

16
00:00:55,110 --> 00:01:02,430
And how could people get a really good education without needing to borrow eighty thousand dollars a

17
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:05,190
year to go to a great university.

18
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:07,580
OK so what do you think about that.

19
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:08,660
Give me an idea.

20
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:09,930
How could we do this.

21
00:01:10,030 --> 00:01:11,920
And I'm not going to go into that.

22
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:15,540
It's just a question that we could ask if we want to discuss that.

23
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:21,410
And I've had that conversation many times I've asked that question many times.

24
00:01:21,870 --> 00:01:29,430
If you were that debt what would you do to if you were the president of your country.

25
00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:34,380
What would you do to solve the issue of hunger in poor areas.

26
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:36,540
Now we're thinking about a hypothetical.

27
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:41,380
Remember we talked about a hypothetical question which is where we imagine it right.

28
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:46,680
If you were the president where you're not the president but if you were what would you do if people

29
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:51,680
who smoked didn't need to worry about getting cancer what would be the result.

30
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:53,370
Would they still smoke or not.

31
00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:55,440
What would smoking be really popular.

32
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:56,880
Would everybody do it or not.

33
00:01:57,100 --> 00:01:57,210
Right.

34
00:01:57,330 --> 00:01:59,050
We can think about these questions.

35
00:01:59,190 --> 00:02:04,440
What would you do is even more open than the smoking one because it's asking someone to describe an

36
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:05,160
action.

37
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:05,600
OK.

38
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:07,700
So then they're talking about steps.

39
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:10,390
First I would do this and then I would do this.

40
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:11,270
And it's fun.

41
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:13,710
It's really fun to explore hypotheticals.

42
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:20,120
So using this what would you do if is a really powerful way to get somebodies brain moving.

43
00:02:20,130 --> 00:02:20,400
OK.

44
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:25,150
What do you think about now of course this is the most basic type of question.

45
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:26,670
What do you think about a.

46
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:28,140
And you can just say the topic.

47
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:30,770
What do you think about smoking in public.

48
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:37,170
Now people are going to give a very open answer a very wide answer so you can use that in any conversation

49
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,070
at the beginning.

50
00:02:38,070 --> 00:02:39,720
Just be careful with that one.

51
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:42,120
What do you think about smoking in public.

52
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:48,000
What do you think about poverty in your country but you have to know that when you ask that question

53
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:53,250
some people might not have a great thing to say about it because maybe they haven't thought about it

54
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:54,920
before because of that.

55
00:02:54,990 --> 00:02:57,280
Maybe the topic will go that way.

56
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:58,930
Maybe the topic will go that way.

57
00:02:58,950 --> 00:03:02,530
Maybe the topic will go to and die.

58
00:03:02,570 --> 00:03:08,910
You do have to be careful but it can also be a way to really get a conversation going and not push the

59
00:03:08,910 --> 00:03:15,060
person you ask in this direction or that direction give them total freedom first and then follow them

60
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:18,220
go with them based on where they want to go.

61
00:03:18,270 --> 00:03:24,240
That's also a good way to to keep a conversation going to follow another person's interests.
