00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:06,930
Now that we have a few useful words and phrases for telling stories let's tell a story we're gonna talk

2
00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:07,620
about.

3
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:12,190
I'm going to talk about my memory of computers throughout my life.

4
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:18,960
OK I'm going to talk about not only the functionality of the computers but I'm also going to talk about

5
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:24,570
some of my memories connected with them and hopefully when you hear my story you'll think oh it's a

6
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:30,600
really interesting story and it might remind you of some things from when you were younger maybe maybe

7
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:31,560
not.

8
00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:34,210
Maybe we have different different experiences.

9
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:41,550
There are two very important tips that you need to keep in mind before I do tell this story about the

10
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:46,200
progress of computers in my life through my own experience.

11
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:52,160
Number one and it seems very simple to say this but do not forget the past tense.

12
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:58,980
One of the most common problems for non-native English speakers English learners is that they forget

13
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:02,310
the past tense when they should actually use it.

14
00:01:02,310 --> 00:01:03,720
This is a huge one.

15
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:07,940
It seems so basic and maybe you think it doesn't matter it's so small.

16
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:16,170
It matters because when you're not careful about this you sound like you're clearly saying to other

17
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:19,110
people I'm not a native English speaker.

18
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:21,040
I'm not very fluent in English.

19
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:22,530
It's so basic.

20
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:28,200
And yet often very hard because there are so many times to remember to do it.

21
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:30,220
So it's got to become a deep habit.

22
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:35,480
Now how can you build that deep habit to remember to use the past tense when you know you should.

23
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:41,700
Well one of the problems that many people have is that they forget because they're speaking too fast.

24
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:46,360
So what you can do is slow down when you learn the piano.

25
00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:47,850
Do you start playing the piano.

26
00:01:47,870 --> 00:01:49,110
Not at a limited level.

27
00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:51,180
No you start playing very slowly.

28
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:56,570
Dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun right.

29
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:01,590
Very slow Then you master it and increase your speed.

30
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:04,190
Slow down.

31
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:06,820
Listen to what you're saying.

32
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:08,600
Did you just say.

33
00:02:08,730 --> 00:02:11,890
And then I go to the store.

34
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,970
Did I just say and then I go to the store.

35
00:02:14,970 --> 00:02:16,920
Oh I did.

36
00:02:16,990 --> 00:02:23,730
You need to say and then I went to the store or as I was going to the store.

37
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:28,680
The point is you need to be able to hear what you just said what is coming out of your mouth.

38
00:02:28,810 --> 00:02:33,880
Because that is the first step to being able to catch mistakes.

39
00:02:33,970 --> 00:02:40,360
And the reason I always ask you to record after each lesson is that you can begin to listen to those

40
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:44,210
and hear where you're making mistakes and self correct.

41
00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:47,010
The next step is to be able to hear them as you're speaking.

42
00:02:47,020 --> 00:02:53,920
And if you speak slowly you can do that and then you're able to actually self correct maybe before it

43
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:55,690
even comes out of your mouth.

44
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:59,470
And then that sounds natural and that then will become a habit.

45
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:03,790
And once it becomes a habit then you won't need to think about it anymore.

46
00:03:03,790 --> 00:03:06,500
I don't think about grammar when I speak English.

47
00:03:06,610 --> 00:03:09,390
I don't think about the past tense when I speak English.

48
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:11,500
It just comes out of my mouth.

49
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:13,180
It's such a deep habit.

50
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:17,870
So I want you to keep this in mind when you're telling your story that you don't need to do it quickly.

51
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:19,780
There's no pressure to speak quickly.

52
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:20,340
OK.

53
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:21,280
That's the first thing.

54
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,430
The second thing.

55
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:29,470
The second tip you need to keep in mind is that no story is interesting if it's all details so make

56
00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:32,870
sure you connect emotion and memory to it.

57
00:03:32,890 --> 00:03:34,920
What was your life like at that time.

58
00:03:34,930 --> 00:03:36,690
What other things were going on.

59
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:38,920
How did you feel about that thing.

60
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:45,100
It's very important to connect those things to the details because if you don't then it's just a description

61
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:47,480
of a thing which is very boring.

62
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:53,650
People like to hear about how you felt at the time where people write where humans so keep those two

63
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:54,490
things in mind.

64
00:03:54,550 --> 00:03:57,580
Let's actually look at my story.
