1
00:00:04,050 --> 00:00:11,880
In the last lesson we talked about how to have a discussion very very important in everyday English

2
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:16,380
especially if you want to have better friendships right.

3
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:22,830
In this lesson though we're going to talk about how you explain things not only how we describe things

4
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:30,260
in detail but how we connect our memories to those things how we connect our emotions to those things.

5
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:33,470
Remember earlier in the course we talked about descriptions.

6
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:41,280
This will be connected to that but we're going to also connect our feelings to the descriptions that

7
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:47,190
we give and when we do that what we basically if it's about an event or if it's about things that happened

8
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:50,590
to us in the past we call that a story.

9
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:59,940
And stories are a very deep part of human culture a very deep part of how humans how people talk to

10
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:01,410
each other.

11
00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:06,650
So I believe this is just my opinion.

12
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:12,180
I believe that stories are everywhere around us even in our daily lives.

13
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:16,890
I believe that you tell stories much more than you think you actually do.

14
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:18,860
That's what I believe.

15
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:24,840
I think that when we when we talk about what happened to us today and we say what terrible thing our

16
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:32,400
boss did or we talk about the great thing that happened last week on our vacation and we share the unexpected

17
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:36,840
thing where the unexpected maybe the unexpected person we met.

18
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:37,740
That's a story.

19
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:44,820
And if you're able to lay out not only the details of the story but also express your emotions and your

20
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:50,940
feelings and the things that happened in a way that are really interesting people are going to want

21
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:52,750
to focus on you right.

22
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:58,380
So in this class we're going to be talking about progress and we're going to try to make it more like

23
00:01:58,470 --> 00:02:00,500
more like a story.

24
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:05,740
OK progress means something usually is moving forward and getting better.

25
00:02:05,910 --> 00:02:08,610
When we talk about progress we don't talk about things getting worse.

26
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:16,460
We talk about things getting better whether it's our culture maybe it's our culture maybe it's education

27
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:24,980
we're going to focus on progress as a way to as a way to focus ourselves around these skills related

28
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:26,410
to telling stories.

29
00:02:26,630 --> 00:02:31,730
And I'm going to share some important vocabulary words we need to know then we're going to talk about

30
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:37,460
a couple of tips and then we'll look at an example so that you can get a feeling about how to do that

31
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:42,830
so that you can actually see the tips and the words that we're going to learn in action.
