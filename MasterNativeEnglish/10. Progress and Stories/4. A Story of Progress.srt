1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:10,200
When I was really little back in the early 90s my dad had an old word processor an old word processor

2
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:18,160
word processor is what Microsoft Word is it's basically something that you would use just for writing.

3
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:20,890
But it was a whole computer only for that.

4
00:00:20,930 --> 00:00:26,750
My dad had an old word processor and it could only do one thing process words.

5
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:30,950
It had no games and so I wasn't interested at all.

6
00:00:31,940 --> 00:00:32,420
OK.

7
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:36,170
Try sharing my emotions trying to share my feeling about this thing.

8
00:00:36,250 --> 00:00:43,240
Back then most computers were similar to that very simple no games no fun.

9
00:00:43,270 --> 00:00:53,080
A few years later though our family got a brand new computer with Windows 95 Windows 95 and that had

10
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:56,820
way more functionality that could do much more.

11
00:00:56,830 --> 00:00:59,590
It could it could do many many more things.

12
00:00:59,590 --> 00:01:08,180
It had a color screen games and mass paint and it could even play videos.

13
00:01:08,230 --> 00:01:12,770
It could even play videos but no internet.

14
00:01:12,790 --> 00:01:16,670
It could also say it had no Internet there was no Internet.

15
00:01:16,690 --> 00:01:20,740
It totally blew my mind at first.

16
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:25,680
It means something so amazing or so crazy you can't believe it.

17
00:01:25,690 --> 00:01:27,990
It totally blew my mind at first.

18
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,780
And I was so excited to use it.

19
00:01:31,810 --> 00:01:38,290
So I'm talking about what it had some of the functionality and also trying to connect my emotion in

20
00:01:38,290 --> 00:01:42,410
that time back then to to getting that computer.

21
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:51,100
I played some of those games for hours on end and still feel nostalgic about ski free and M.S. paint

22
00:01:51,490 --> 00:01:58,080
ski free was an as a game where you were a skier and you'd ski down a mountain and then at the end of

23
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:06,090
a game the this this monster would come out and eat you would always eat you always.

24
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:08,310
And it was very frustrating and very scary.

25
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:10,420
But the game was super fun.

26
00:02:10,420 --> 00:02:18,790
Nostalgia is this feeling of a warm emotion a happy memory connected to something in the past we ever

27
00:02:18,790 --> 00:02:26,980
had a smell come into your nose and suddenly it brings you back to when you were in high school your

28
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:30,600
first girlfriend or you hear a song and it does the same.

29
00:02:30,670 --> 00:02:39,300
When I think of MS Paint or I see or I see the ski free monster I am transported back so I feel nostalgic.

30
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:47,140
When I was 10 we got a Dell and that computer could connect to the Internet but it was really really

31
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:47,740
slow.

32
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:55,390
Web pages would take 20 seconds to load and I'd have to use the phone line to connect.

33
00:02:55,390 --> 00:02:58,660
You couldn't be on and when I say you couldn't be on.

34
00:02:58,660 --> 00:03:00,940
This is called the impersonal you.

35
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:03,880
It just means anybody who's doing that.

36
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:10,800
Anybody who's using the Internet you when you want to succeed in life you have to work hard.

37
00:03:10,810 --> 00:03:17,830
Maybe I'm just saying that in general to anybody who wants to be successful or may want to be successful.

38
00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:24,460
The impersonal you you couldn't be on the phone and using the Internet at the same time.

39
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:33,370
So if I was chatting with my friends on a I am which was a very popular chat or messenger at the time.

40
00:03:33,610 --> 00:03:42,370
If I was chatting with my friends on a I am sometimes my mom would shout upstairs Hey get off the internet

41
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:50,210
I need to call grandma because I was using the Internet the phone line was blocked because it went over

42
00:03:50,210 --> 00:03:51,020
the phone.

43
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:57,140
So when my mom needed to make a call she had to ask me to stop looking at my email or whatever so that

44
00:03:57,140 --> 00:03:59,960
she could make a phone call very primitive.

45
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:00,410
Right.

46
00:04:00,410 --> 00:04:01,700
Very very primitive.

47
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:07,820
Now if I were telling this story more casually with friends I would probably go into even more detail

48
00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:15,290
on each point I wanted to give you a simple example so that you could get a feeling and see how I would

49
00:04:15,290 --> 00:04:24,380
connect my emotions nostalgic about this or I was so excited about this how I would connect my emotions

50
00:04:24,830 --> 00:04:32,730
to the thing that was happening or the actual object the actual computer or the actual technology right.

51
00:04:33,170 --> 00:04:40,850
So I hope that gives you a clear idea about how we can use some of these words and phrases and also

52
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:43,310
how we can tell a story that's interesting.

53
00:04:43,370 --> 00:04:50,920
Keeping in mind that if I were telling this story more casually I would say probably much much more.

54
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:54,580
And it would be much more casual I would just speak freely.

55
00:04:54,590 --> 00:04:57,980
I'm writing this down for you so that you can see it.

56
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:06,050
So now it's time to practice this but I'd like you to do is tell me about the phones that you've owned

57
00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:08,150
in your lifetime.

58
00:05:08,150 --> 00:05:15,320
The phones that you remember throughout your life maybe starting with a landline phone and then moving

59
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:18,860
to the phone that you own now maybe a smartphone.

60
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:25,730
Talk about the differences between the phones the functionality but also talk about what was going on

61
00:05:25,730 --> 00:05:31,010
in your life at the time some of your memories that are connected to that thing.

62
00:05:31,010 --> 00:05:32,730
How did you use it right.

63
00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:37,780
And again try to connect emotion to events and description.

64
00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:42,290
Try to use some of the words and phrases that we learned earlier in the class.

65
00:05:42,290 --> 00:05:43,640
You don't have to use all of them.

66
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:50,150
Certainly I didn't try to use some of them right back then which is an easy one to use.

67
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:56,090
Try to use these when you do it and you recorded and then you listen back to it.

68
00:05:56,090 --> 00:05:59,390
If it's a good story at some point you should smile.

69
00:05:59,390 --> 00:06:04,970
If you smile or maybe your mom smiles or your friends smiles when they listen to it then at least you

70
00:06:04,970 --> 00:06:12,620
know that you've made something you've done something that is able to move people and that's what stories

71
00:06:13,010 --> 00:06:14,030
are all about.

72
00:06:14,030 --> 00:06:21,340
Whether it's a happy story a sad story or just one that is connected to your real emotions in some way.
