1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:05,940
So now let's just look at a couple of key vocabulary words and a few phrases that we can use for what

2
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:08,550
we're going to talk about in this lesson.

3
00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:10,650
So let's start with development.

4
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:12,080
Well we talked about progress.

5
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:15,680
That means things are getting better with time moving forward.

6
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:19,080
Development can be very similar to progress.

7
00:00:19,110 --> 00:00:24,990
It's often used in the same way but development can also be related to something just getting maybe

8
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:26,510
more mature.

9
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:33,420
For example when we when we want to explain our personalities when we want to talk about getting older

10
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:38,730
we're talking about maturity and sometimes we're talking about physically getting bigger.

11
00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:44,820
So we often call that development but we usually don't call that progress development doesn't always

12
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:51,530
have to be in the direction of it's getting better and better and better not necessarily develop maybe

13
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:58,140
just means it's getting a little bit more sometimes complicated sometimes more mature.

14
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:03,180
Sometimes it's just getting a bit more advanced and it's not always a good thing.

15
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:06,360
But it's very similar development has other meanings as well.

16
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:13,180
But that's the one we're gonna focus on functionality is often used to talk about technology.

17
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:19,650
We could be talking about gadgets That's a G could be talking about gadgets we could be talking about

18
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:22,100
bigger things like satellites.

19
00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:26,280
Gadgets are usually smaller but it's often electronic stuff.

20
00:01:26,550 --> 00:01:29,370
And functionality is what those things do.

21
00:01:29,370 --> 00:01:36,090
So if we're talking about our devices like our cell phones for example or smartphones smartphone is

22
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:38,550
a phone that can use the Internet maybe has apps.

23
00:01:38,550 --> 00:01:39,990
If we're going to talk about that.

24
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:47,940
Usually when people review a smartphone or maybe buy one they ask questions about its functionality.

25
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,330
What can it do is basically the meaning of functionality.

26
00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:53,250
What can this thing do.

27
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:58,540
And again it's often used for technology if something is very simple very basic.

28
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:06,060
Maybe it was useful a long time ago but now there are many many things which are better than it then

29
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:13,240
we will use the word primitive sometimes primitive can be related to ideas it can be related to people.

30
00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:17,660
It could be related to traditions primitive traditions.

31
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:20,860
It could be related to technology.

32
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:24,740
You could have a technology like a phone from when you were a kid.

33
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:25,080
Right.

34
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:28,980
And that technology seems now very primitive.

35
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:34,620
Our smartphones now are very advanced they seem very modern compared to the primitive phones that we

36
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:38,220
used to carry around maybe in the 1990s.

37
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:41,160
Now old school is I think a really interesting one.

38
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:46,500
Old school is related to the idea of something being kind of classic.

39
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:48,460
And so it's often used in a good way.

40
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,280
Well that phone is old school.

41
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:55,390
If somebody pulls out what's called a flip phone that you flip open it's got a flip phone.

42
00:02:55,390 --> 00:03:01,230
If somebody takes out a flip phone and says yeah you go Oh that phone is old school.

43
00:03:01,230 --> 00:03:02,640
That's not to be too critical.

44
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:07,990
It's often to say that's kind of interesting that you have a really old flip phone.

45
00:03:08,070 --> 00:03:11,270
Old school old school it's used in sports.

46
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:12,870
It's used for technology.

47
00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:18,570
It's used for ideas to use for sometimes fashion old school.

48
00:03:18,570 --> 00:03:19,890
It's got nothing to do with school.

49
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:25,710
Now there are a few phrases we can also use when we're talking about things that happened in the past

50
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:31,170
which is what we're going to do in this in this lesson we're going to be focusing on past telling a

51
00:03:31,170 --> 00:03:36,930
story back then is used when you already have said another time.

52
00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:46,990
So for example in nineteen ninety nine when I was in sixth grade I had a math teacher who was always

53
00:03:46,990 --> 00:03:48,830
very critical of me.

54
00:03:48,970 --> 00:03:54,140
Back then there was no way for students to give feedback to their teachers.

55
00:03:54,190 --> 00:04:00,550
So back then it's used once you've already said the time to reference it so that you don't need to say

56
00:04:00,910 --> 00:04:03,020
that year again or that time again.

57
00:04:03,070 --> 00:04:05,830
It's often used for a time long ago.

58
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:11,100
It's not used for usually 20 minutes ago or hours ago or even months ago.

59
00:04:11,140 --> 00:04:14,830
It's usually used four years ago way back then.

60
00:04:14,830 --> 00:04:20,850
We can also say way back then way back then when I was.

61
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:27,910
So this is a very simple one and we use this one to either talk about our age in a certain time in the

62
00:04:27,910 --> 00:04:34,690
past or our status at a certain time in the past when I was 10 years old.

63
00:04:34,690 --> 00:04:42,370
You could also say when I was in middle school in middle school and this is a way to again give the

64
00:04:42,370 --> 00:04:49,060
person listening to your story a clear idea about the time so that they're able to picture that very

65
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:54,010
well before you say what happened as we talked about in our earlier lesson about description it's very

66
00:04:54,010 --> 00:05:01,150
important to give a clear picture to the other person before you actually get into more details or more

67
00:05:01,150 --> 00:05:02,490
complicated things.

68
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:04,450
Now I could only and I could even.

69
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:11,680
These two are very common when we want to talk about limitations and things that are so good that they

70
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:18,180
have some big advantage that basically the same structure but they have almost opposite meanings.

71
00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:24,760
If I could say I could only then we're talking about limitation limitation means something you cannot

72
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:27,150
do something something cannot do.

73
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:35,890
So for example when I was a kid about 12 years old I remember I got a at the time that was called a

74
00:05:35,890 --> 00:05:46,800
flash drive a little card a little USP actually was a USP thumb drive that could only could only store

75
00:05:46,890 --> 00:05:48,660
about 50 pictures.

76
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:53,750
Now that's unbelievable to think about something that only stores 50 pictures.

77
00:05:53,790 --> 00:06:02,900
Back then I could only store 50 pictures or songs in my USP drive today.

78
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:10,110
The USB drive I have can store whole Udemy courses can store much more.

79
00:06:10,130 --> 00:06:13,620
It could only do that back then it was limited.

80
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:16,830
It could even is pretty much the opposite here.

81
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:22,070
If you say it could even do this it's like saying this is good this is good.

82
00:06:22,070 --> 00:06:25,370
And wow there's one more which is even better.

83
00:06:25,370 --> 00:06:31,990
So let's look at an example or how we could use that and we're often going to be talking about functionality

84
00:06:32,090 --> 00:06:42,080
for example of technology when we use it could only or it could even I had a slider phone in high school

85
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:47,760
I was going to put H.S. slider phone is a phone that you would slide up and slide down.

86
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:49,000
Not really a smartphone.

87
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:49,650
OK.

88
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:53,120
Now there are many limitations with a smartphone like that.

89
00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:53,540
Ah sorry.

90
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:56,410
A phone like that a phone like that.

91
00:06:56,420 --> 00:07:06,940
So then I could say it was it was really advanced at the time so maybe it compared to phones.

92
00:07:06,950 --> 00:07:09,590
Now it can't do much but at that time.

93
00:07:09,590 --> 00:07:10,260
Wow.

94
00:07:10,490 --> 00:07:15,720
It was really advanced it could do a lot of things should we say it was really progressed.

95
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:16,350
No.

96
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:23,390
Just to be clear when we talk about that thing the adjective of that thing we say it's very advanced.

97
00:07:23,390 --> 00:07:29,630
Sometimes we say it's very developed although often for a phone for technology we don't use developed

98
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:38,210
we use developed maybe for language we use it developed for a person we use developed for a topic or

99
00:07:38,210 --> 00:07:40,300
a maybe a a subject.

100
00:07:40,330 --> 00:07:40,560
Right.

101
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:46,340
Very developed a country even we could say developed advanced is often for technology.

102
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:49,820
So I had a slider phone in high school.

103
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:53,300
It was really advanced at the time.

104
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:55,390
It was really advanced at the time.

105
00:07:55,460 --> 00:08:02,840
It could even or I could even if I said it could even say what it can do if I say I could even.

106
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:07,900
I'll say what I could do with it I could even listen to music on it.

107
00:08:08,330 --> 00:08:10,420
I could even listen to music on it.

108
00:08:10,430 --> 00:08:10,960
What.

109
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:15,130
At that time you could listen to music using headphones on a phone.

110
00:08:15,170 --> 00:08:18,400
Yeah it could even connect to the Internet.

111
00:08:18,470 --> 00:08:20,620
What it could connect to the Internet.

112
00:08:20,630 --> 00:08:26,430
Yes yes pretty advanced for that time or pretty advanced at the time.

113
00:08:26,570 --> 00:08:29,200
So these words and phrases can be used in many ways.

114
00:08:29,210 --> 00:08:35,240
But the reason I share them is because they are very common as ways to talk about things that happened

115
00:08:35,630 --> 00:08:38,930
in the past which improved over time.

116
00:08:38,930 --> 00:08:43,220
Things which developed over time things which progressed over time.

117
00:08:43,310 --> 00:08:50,690
And since we're really talking about technology and its progress over time it's important to know these

118
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:51,820
words and phrases.

119
00:08:51,830 --> 00:08:59,030
So let's now move on and talk about an example or real example of how we can do this how we can tell

120
00:08:59,030 --> 00:09:00,830
a story about the past.
