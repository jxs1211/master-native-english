1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:07,560
I often use this expression this phrasing when I want to disagree with someone because it's really cool.

2
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:09,260
It's very powerful.

3
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:11,420
It's very interesting I'll show you how it works.

4
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:18,690
But basically what we say is if that were true why and then give an opposite example.

5
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:21,230
Now let me explain what that means.

6
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:28,000
If that were true means it is not true or at least I believe it is not true.

7
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:31,740
So you have made a statement saying that something is true.

8
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:38,010
You have said the drinking age at 21 in the USA is a good way to prevent drinking problems later in

9
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:39,050
life.

10
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:41,160
I believe that's the opposite.

11
00:00:41,490 --> 00:00:43,830
If what you said were true it's not.

12
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:49,350
If it were Amber were is when we want to talk about something that's not real something that's hypothetical

13
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:55,890
and what I can do here is give an opposite example or say something that is not true that should be

14
00:00:55,890 --> 00:00:56,580
true.

15
00:00:56,580 --> 00:01:05,700
If you were correct which you're not Yes I could say if that were true then why isn't the rate of alcoholism

16
00:01:05,730 --> 00:01:08,270
decreasing it's not decreasing right.

17
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:10,140
Why isn't it decreasing.

18
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:14,580
If that were true the rate of alcoholism should be decreasing.

19
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:20,030
You can make a statement like that if that were true then would just leave y to the side for a second.

20
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:27,990
If that were true the rate of alcoholism should be decreasing.

21
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:28,570
Right.

22
00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:29,520
But it isn't.

23
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:30,510
But it isn't.

24
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:32,600
It's not see how this graph here.

25
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:34,560
It's not it's the same.

26
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:41,310
So it's a great way to show how what you're saying is illogical or there's something wrong with your

27
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:42,660
facts or whatever.

28
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:49,490
Now we can also then state we can also then state something that is true that shouldn't be there.

29
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:51,150
If you were correct.

30
00:01:51,170 --> 00:01:51,500
OK.

31
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:52,590
Which means you're not correct.

32
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:58,260
So now I'm going to bring back why I really like this one especially why because it makes the other

33
00:01:58,260 --> 00:02:00,030
side have to explain something.

34
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:04,060
And anytime you use the word y the other side has to explain.

35
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:10,710
And if they explain something or try to explain something that isn't right then it's it's hard to do

36
00:02:10,710 --> 00:02:13,300
and maybe they're going to make themselves look very silly.

37
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:18,780
So if that were true if that were true why are there.

38
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:19,460
This is true.

39
00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:20,420
Now this part is true.

40
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:28,720
Why are there so many under age drinking hyphen related deaths now.

41
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:35,220
Or I could say with the drinking age as it is I say with the drinking age as it is with the drinking

42
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:36,660
age as it is or now.

43
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:38,940
OK now you have to answer this question.

44
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:44,540
The fact is that many underage people underage means under the age of 21.

45
00:02:44,610 --> 00:02:45,670
Many die.

46
00:02:45,670 --> 00:02:52,090
Maybe car accidents make driving under the influence we say or drinking too much.

47
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:55,050
Whatever the reason there are lots of different possibilities.

48
00:02:55,050 --> 00:03:00,570
It's very sad it's very unfortunate but I'm pointing this out to say I think you're I think you're incorrect.

49
00:03:00,570 --> 00:03:03,570
If that were true why oh why did I write why.

50
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:04,970
Twice OK you get the idea.

51
00:03:05,070 --> 00:03:08,700
Why are there so many underage drinking deaths now.

52
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:10,180
Question mark.

53
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:12,240
Mm hmm.

54
00:03:12,270 --> 00:03:13,170
Good question.

55
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:16,920
You might have a difficult time answering that if you are the other side.

56
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:17,490
Right.

57
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:20,490
OK so this is another very powerful way.

58
00:03:20,490 --> 00:03:29,220
After you say why you say something that is true that contradicts or is opposite to what would be true

59
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:36,090
if the other side was correct which they are not or you say something that should be true.

60
00:03:36,270 --> 00:03:39,990
If they were correct but that is not currently true.

61
00:03:39,990 --> 00:03:44,580
OK so there are two ways to do it but this beginning phrasing here.

62
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:51,510
If that were true is quite useful and quite powerful not only in debates but anytime you really want

63
00:03:51,510 --> 00:03:59,380
to disagree with somebody and show the other side very simply and effectively why they're probably incorrect.

64
00:03:59,490 --> 00:04:00,240
Very powerful.
