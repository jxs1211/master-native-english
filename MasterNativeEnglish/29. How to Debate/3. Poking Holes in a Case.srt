1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:06,840
OK so we've talked about why we might have a debate and we've discussed some of the roles of the debate

2
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:11,750
and some of the different the different words related to having a debate.

3
00:00:11,750 --> 00:00:17,320
OK let's now talk about some of the phrases we can use in the debate itself.

4
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:22,440
And we're going to look at phrases for how we can poke holes in a case.

5
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:23,070
What does that mean.

6
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:28,360
Well as I said before when you have a debate you build a case for something right.

7
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:29,600
This is my case.

8
00:00:29,610 --> 00:00:32,630
I'm making a case for whatever it is.

9
00:00:32,670 --> 00:00:38,910
Maybe we're talking about the drinking age here to poke holes in that is to show where the weak points

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,210
are and make it look weaker.

11
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:48,050
On the other side imagine you have a bag full of water and you dig deep dig poke holes in it.

12
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:50,400
What will happen to the water.

13
00:00:50,580 --> 00:00:51,770
It will leak out.

14
00:00:51,810 --> 00:00:58,290
So when we're having a debate one thing we can do is use a couple of specific phrases to show the weaknesses

15
00:00:58,290 --> 00:01:02,250
of the other side not the other person but just the arguments being made.

16
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:02,660
OK.

17
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:04,410
So let's look at how we can do that.

18
00:01:04,410 --> 00:01:06,500
Let me introduce this topic first.

19
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:12,630
The drinking age at 21 in the USA is a good way to prevent drinking problems later in life.

20
00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:19,140
Now I don't know if you know this but in the United States you have to be 21 years or older in order

21
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:22,320
to in order to actually buy alcohol.

22
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:26,920
You say it's the legal drinking age 21 years or older.

23
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:27,430
OK.

24
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:28,890
Some people say it's a good idea.

25
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:30,420
Some people say it's a bad idea.

26
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:32,600
It's very controversial.

27
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:35,510
OK well it doesn't matter how you feel about it OK.

28
00:01:35,590 --> 00:01:40,890
But we're not going to focus on your opinion or my opinion but let's just say we're going to disagree

29
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:41,400
with this.

30
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:45,850
We're going to either actually disagree or play the devil's advocate.

31
00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:48,600
And we're going to look at some phrases we can use.

32
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:56,280
Well one thing we can do is ask a question and we ask a question to force the other side to say yes

33
00:01:56,400 --> 00:02:02,430
about something related to a point that is against what they said or against their own argument.

34
00:02:02,450 --> 00:02:10,290
OK you want to find or pick out true statements small statements that might disagree with their side

35
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:12,650
and they should be factual statements.

36
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:16,190
That means they should be facts F A C.T. s. They should be true.

37
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:18,950
And then the other side has to say yeah that's true.

38
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:20,160
Yes that's true.

39
00:02:20,170 --> 00:02:21,180
Aha yeah that's true.

40
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:28,980
And if you make them agree the other side to small points that are smaller than the main argument you

41
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:33,150
force them to do that then it makes their side look weaker.

42
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:38,200
This is a very simple thing to do but this is a common debate tactic or strategy.

43
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:40,960
You can off often use the word tactic.

44
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:42,450
OK so how can we do that.

45
00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:49,440
Well it's very simple and you might see this in movies about court cases where there's a lawyer talking

46
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:52,680
to someone in court isn't it true.

47
00:02:52,770 --> 00:02:54,730
Isn't it true.

48
00:02:54,780 --> 00:03:00,300
Now this is a very powerful beginning because all they have to say to answer this is yes.

49
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:07,910
And if they say no then they have to defend it and say why a fact that you're stating is not true.

50
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:09,500
So you should say something that's true.

51
00:03:09,510 --> 00:03:11,110
So they have to say yes.

52
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:25,780
Isn't it true that that many high school students get drunk at least once before age 21.

53
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:28,930
Now you have to say yes to that because it is true.

54
00:03:28,950 --> 00:03:30,450
There are movies about it.

55
00:03:30,450 --> 00:03:31,700
It's a fact.

56
00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:37,260
Many high school students do get drunk at least some point before they turn 21.

57
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:38,090
It's true.

58
00:03:38,110 --> 00:03:39,800
You have to say yes that's true.

59
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:46,320
So I'm building to something maybe I then make another statement like this now isn't it true that blah

60
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:46,820
blah blah.

61
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:47,950
You can make another one.

62
00:03:47,970 --> 00:03:53,770
So I'm slowly breaking down your position your view your case.

63
00:03:53,770 --> 00:03:53,990
OK.

64
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,170
Now how about this one.

65
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,830
And I'm not saying this is a fact.

66
00:03:56,990 --> 00:03:57,980
I'm not totally sure.

67
00:03:57,990 --> 00:04:04,930
But isn't it true that the rate of alcoholism hasn't decreased over the last 40 years.

68
00:04:05,010 --> 00:04:10,740
Now if what you're saying is true the drinking age at 21 is a good idea if what you're saying is true

69
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:19,050
then we should see that alcoholism or people being addicted to alcohol which is what alcoholism is addicted

70
00:04:19,290 --> 00:04:20,080
to alcohol.

71
00:04:20,130 --> 00:04:21,400
We should see it going down.

72
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:21,720
Right.

73
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:22,770
If it's working.

74
00:04:22,770 --> 00:04:30,750
OK so if I say this isn't it true that the rate of alcoholism hasn't decreased hasn't gone down over

75
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:33,690
the last 40 years maybe I have a graph here.

76
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:34,230
Right.

77
00:04:34,230 --> 00:04:38,890
As you can see from this graph this is the rate of alcoholism it hasn't gone down.

78
00:04:38,910 --> 00:04:44,070
Isn't it true that the rate of alcoholism hasn't gone down over the last 40 years.

79
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:45,250
The other side has to say.

80
00:04:45,430 --> 00:04:46,740
Yeah that's true.

81
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:53,490
So this isn't it true thing can be a very very powerful tool when you use it correctly when you ask

82
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:57,290
the right questions can't always use it but in many cases you can.

83
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:58,930
And I really like it.

84
00:04:58,950 --> 00:05:04,840
Now we're going to look at one more question phrase that we can use when we want to show that we believe

85
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:08,480
the other side is wrong and provide an opposite fact.
