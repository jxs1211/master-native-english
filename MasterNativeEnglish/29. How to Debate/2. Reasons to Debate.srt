1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:05,130
Before we really get started and talk about the phrases that we need to have a debate we should talk

2
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:11,340
about why we would have a debate one why is it useful for an English learner to practice this.

3
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:14,580
And two why is it useful in general to have a debate.

4
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:20,220
Well the answer to the first question is if you have to debate you're not only for example giving a

5
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:28,080
presentation and explaining an idea you have to listen to what other people say process that and then

6
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:34,320
think very quickly of how to respond in a way that makes their side look weaker and your side looks

7
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:34,920
stronger.

8
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:37,830
That's generally what a debate is all about.

9
00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:39,280
You have to do it clearly.

10
00:00:39,310 --> 00:00:46,080
You have to use everything that you know your ability to describe your ability to maybe express data

11
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:49,140
or technical details organize your thoughts.

12
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:50,680
This can be very challenging.

13
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:57,030
But by practicing this and I would recommend having debates as often as you can by practicing this you're

14
00:00:57,030 --> 00:01:03,870
going to really develop the ability to have quick conversations get back to people right away and have

15
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:07,310
a discussion where you have to engage your mind.

16
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:13,800
So it's a great way to actually practice your English language spoken English language abilities.

17
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:20,330
But on the other side of that a debate is useful in many other many other situations many other cases.

18
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:28,500
Imagine you have a company or you're in a company and you're going to launch a product launch a product

19
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:33,090
and maybe there's a question about what feature to launch.

20
00:01:33,190 --> 00:01:33,370
OK.

21
00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:36,800
So let's say a feature is one of the things a product may have.

22
00:01:36,850 --> 00:01:41,730
OK let's say that if you add the feature let's call it feature a.

23
00:01:41,910 --> 00:01:45,600
It's going to take two more months before the product can be launched.

24
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:50,400
And if you don't have the feature you can launch it right away but then it won't have the feature and

25
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:53,210
maybe it's not as attractive to customers.

26
00:01:53,220 --> 00:02:00,490
So one thing you could do is set up a debate in maybe your team where you have two sides to people.

27
00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:04,790
Your job is to argue that we launch in two months with the feature.

28
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:12,180
Your job is to argue that we launch now without the feature and we will decide maybe or it will help

29
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:14,080
the person who is going to make the decision.

30
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:22,650
Decide soon faster or at least with a better understanding of the pros and cons of each side.

31
00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:29,720
So it can be a very very valuable thing having a debate in companies in groups sometimes even with friends.

32
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:30,210
OK.

33
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:36,480
So we can by having a debate maybe explore all possible avenues.

34
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:42,570
This is a common expression it means I don't know all of the possible ways that this thing can be done.

35
00:02:42,570 --> 00:02:48,900
So I'm going to have a debate to help me figure out what possibilities there are to explore all possible

36
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:51,330
avenues avenues are roads.

37
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:52,100
OK.

38
00:02:52,230 --> 00:03:04,560
We may want to we may want to work out work out the kinks the kinks of an issue the Kinks a kink is

39
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:09,780
something that's sort of a problem that may stick or cause other things to stick.

40
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:14,790
So for example if you have a hose and there's a kink in it in the middle that means water cannot flow

41
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:15,470
through it.

42
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:22,230
So having a debate here might mean talking about in a debate format where the problems are and then

43
00:03:22,290 --> 00:03:24,710
figuring out the best ways to resolve them.

44
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:31,590
Looking at both sides of it we can also as I mentioned before look at the pros and cons.

45
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:38,550
This is a very simple way to say the advantages and the disadvantages the good things and the bad things.

46
00:03:38,730 --> 00:03:41,870
We often just say what are the pros and cons of this.

47
00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:45,480
What are the pros and cons of this.

48
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:47,070
It's a very common expression.

49
00:03:47,070 --> 00:03:48,750
Well the pros are blah blah blah.

50
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:49,990
The cons are that.

51
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:54,360
And we often need to explore these for example should we launch the product.

52
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:55,610
What are the pros of that.

53
00:03:55,650 --> 00:03:56,890
What are the cons of that.

54
00:03:57,100 --> 00:03:59,640
OK the debate format is great for that.

55
00:03:59,670 --> 00:04:03,870
Now what's the difference between having a debate and having an argument.

56
00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:12,060
I use the word make an argument for one side when I say that expression when I say to make an argument

57
00:04:12,370 --> 00:04:18,690
I could also be saying to make a case or to build a case that basically means to come up with things

58
00:04:18,690 --> 00:04:20,360
that support one side.

59
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:29,010
It doesn't mean to argue in the way that we normally think of it an argument in most uses or most cases

60
00:04:29,010 --> 00:04:35,760
is two people fighting shouting at each other maybe throwing glasses of red wine at each other right.

61
00:04:35,790 --> 00:04:41,670
That's an argument OK usually but we can use argument in this way when we're talking about a debate

62
00:04:41,670 --> 00:04:47,870
to make an argument to make a case for something when we want to express I believe this.

63
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:52,290
This is my view and I'm going to then make points that support this.

64
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:54,710
I'm going to build a case for this.

65
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:59,400
This is my conclusion and my points are a b c and d.

66
00:04:59,410 --> 00:05:00,730
This is my argument.

67
00:05:00,770 --> 00:05:04,490
These are all the things I'm going to say to support this basic idea.

68
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:10,660
So that's what we mean when we use the word argument or case when we're talking about a debate.

69
00:05:10,670 --> 00:05:17,690
Now the last thing I want to mention before we get into the phrases for having a debate the last thing

70
00:05:17,690 --> 00:05:25,910
I want to mention is this interesting thing which we call the Devil's Advocate now the devil's advocate

71
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:31,900
basically means it's a role the person who always disagrees or says the opposite.

72
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:36,470
As a way to explore or force you to think about things in another way.

73
00:05:36,470 --> 00:05:42,470
So if you say I want to start a new business and I'd like to start maybe a convenience store then I

74
00:05:42,470 --> 00:05:46,280
say well what about all of the other convenience stores in the neighborhood.

75
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:48,590
There are so many there's a lot of competition.

76
00:05:48,590 --> 00:05:52,610
Have you thought about that and maybe that person says so why are you.

77
00:05:52,910 --> 00:05:54,830
You should be excited about my idea.

78
00:05:54,830 --> 00:05:56,370
Why are you disagreeing with me.

79
00:05:56,390 --> 00:06:00,450
Hey I'm just playing playing devil's advocate.

80
00:06:00,470 --> 00:06:06,440
That means I'm just trying to help you explore why you have this opinion and whether or not it's the

81
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:07,850
right view to have.

82
00:06:07,850 --> 00:06:13,850
I'm helping you so this is kind of a role and when you're having a debate sometimes you need to play

83
00:06:13,850 --> 00:06:17,210
devil's advocate as a way to explore the other side.

84
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:19,540
Maybe you both agree with the same side.

85
00:06:19,610 --> 00:06:20,710
In fact right.

86
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:25,580
Well the devil's advocate role can allow you to figure out what both sides are at least.

87
00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:28,800
So it's an interesting it's an interesting role to play.

88
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:34,520
I really like playing devil's advocate when I have debates either with my colleagues or when I have

89
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:35,850
debates with my friends.

90
00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:39,360
Sometimes I'll take the opposite view that I actually have.

91
00:06:39,470 --> 00:06:42,950
Just for fun just to see if I can make an argument for that.

92
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:43,360
It's fun.
