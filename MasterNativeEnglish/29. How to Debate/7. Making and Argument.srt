1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:05,880
So far in this lesson we've talked about why we debate and we've learned some basic vocabulary that

2
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:08,680
we can use to talk about debates.

3
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:16,080
Then we went into some phrases some expressions we can use when we're having debates to poke holes in

4
00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:18,390
a case or someone else's argument.

5
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:24,360
Then we looked at a couple more we can use when we want to concede a point as a way to shift the focus

6
00:00:24,690 --> 00:00:31,050
away from maybe a weak point we have or make what we call a counterpoint.

7
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:34,260
Now we're going to look at a real example.

8
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:38,270
We're going to look at a debate topic and then we're going to look at two sides.

9
00:00:38,350 --> 00:00:43,890
And we're going to see if we can actually use some of the things that we learned earlier on in this

10
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:44,480
lesson.

11
00:00:44,490 --> 00:00:52,410
So our topic will be video games particularly violent video games violent video games means video games

12
00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:56,250
with violence maybe that's fighting maybe that's killing for example.

13
00:00:56,340 --> 00:01:03,180
And usually that involves blood or something rather rather horrible sometimes disturbing we could say.

14
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:10,060
The question is do violent video games have a negative effect on youth.

15
00:01:10,060 --> 00:01:11,660
OK a negative effect.

16
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:13,300
That means a bad effect.

17
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:18,000
So when we're talking about very young people like kids should they be allowed to play violent video

18
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:18,450
games.

19
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:22,870
If they do well they'd be negatively affected or not affected.

20
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:29,630
And that's the debate when to look first at the side that says hey actually this is a really bad thing.

21
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:33,430
We should not allow very young people to play violent video games.

22
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:35,900
Then we'll look at the opposite view.

23
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:40,950
And again we're going to try to use some of the things we learned early on in this lesson.

24
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:41,280
All right.

25
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:47,420
So this is the side that says yes yes video games have a negative effect.

26
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:48,320
Bad effect.

27
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:55,680
It goes without saying that children are far more likely to learn behaviors from their environment than

28
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:58,170
adults or older teens.

29
00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:03,720
It goes without saying that means it's very obviously true.

30
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:08,100
If you want to say something is very obviously obviously true.

31
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:17,140
You can say it goes without saying that it goes without saying that summer is warmer than winter.

32
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:23,550
It goes without saying that children are far more likely to learn behaviors from their environment.

33
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:29,040
That means the things around them your environment is what's around you from your environment than adults

34
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:31,260
or older teens.

35
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:37,260
So maybe what we're talking about here when we say youth are young people very very young people like

36
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:42,560
children or maybe people in their early teens 13 maybe 14 years old.

37
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:51,720
So it stands to reason that if children are exposed to violent games at a young age they may begin to

38
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:59,870
see violence as a solution to their problems just like it is in games.

39
00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:07,010
OK exposed if we use the word exposed it means you're around that a lot if you're exposed to violence.

40
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:08,840
That means you see a lot of violence.

41
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:15,090
They're exposed to very good things that means maybe you will begin to actually learn and do those good

42
00:03:15,090 --> 00:03:15,780
things.

43
00:03:15,810 --> 00:03:20,470
We can say exposed to the sun exposed just means you're around that.

44
00:03:21,210 --> 00:03:25,170
Stands to reason is a way to say similar to this.

45
00:03:25,170 --> 00:03:34,110
It's obvious but it's very reasonable to say this stands to reason is often a way to say it is reasonable

46
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:35,120
that.

47
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:40,320
OK so it stands to reason it's just a common phrase that we use when we're having discussions making

48
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:47,340
points and especially when we're trying to convince other people to agree with us may begin to see violence

49
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:50,070
as a solution to their problems.

50
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:55,100
A solution to your problems would be how you deal with your problems how you solve your problems.

51
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:55,910
Here's a problem.

52
00:03:56,100 --> 00:04:01,740
Oh if I just punch this person or kill this person that will solve my problem because that's what I

53
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:02,940
learned in games.

54
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:04,410
That's what it's saying here.

55
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:07,900
Just like it is in games because it is in games.

56
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:10,700
You have to kill the bad guys in order to win.

57
00:04:10,830 --> 00:04:17,080
So the basic argument here is the rules of video games are kill bad people win.

58
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:23,550
And the argument is if kids play a lot of violent games then they're going to see everything like that

59
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:27,440
kill people win or do violence win beat people win.

60
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:27,970
OK.

61
00:04:27,990 --> 00:04:29,200
That's the basic point.

62
00:04:29,230 --> 00:04:35,760
Here's an analogy an analogy would be the way ink shows up more clearly on a white cloth.

63
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:43,020
So again we're trying to help the audience or the other side very clearly visualize or see our point

64
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:45,330
and we can use analogies to do that.

65
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:50,760
They have a white cloth and you drop some blue ink some red ink on the white cloth.

66
00:04:50,850 --> 00:04:55,590
It'll be very vivid on the white cloth if you drop it on a brown cloth.

67
00:04:55,590 --> 00:04:57,000
It won't be as vivid.

68
00:04:57,030 --> 00:05:01,760
That is to say maybe young people children are more pure.

69
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:02,470
They're pure.

70
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:08,040
And so whatever they are exposed to at a young age they will be very impacted by that.

71
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:12,040
It will be like ink showing up on a very pure white cloth.

72
00:05:12,050 --> 00:05:15,710
It's more pure so the effect is stronger.

73
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:16,820
Isn't it true.

74
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:18,770
Remember this expression we used.

75
00:05:18,830 --> 00:05:23,120
We want to ask the other side to say yes we want them to agree.

76
00:05:23,210 --> 00:05:30,200
Isn't it true that kids are more impressionable than adults impressionable means that they're more likely

77
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:31,620
to be affected.

78
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:37,850
It's more likely that whatever they are exposed to they will do those things or be more likely to do

79
00:05:37,850 --> 00:05:38,750
those things.

80
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:45,080
Or it's like saying the ink is going to show up more brightly or more vividly on the white cloth and

81
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:47,660
there the white cloth very impressionable.

82
00:05:47,690 --> 00:05:53,390
Oh I see everyone around me being very polite so I will do the same thing because I'm very young I'm

83
00:05:53,390 --> 00:05:54,900
more likely to do that.

84
00:05:55,020 --> 00:06:00,540
OK hopefully all that's clear this is I think a reasonable argument on one side.

85
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:07,760
Now let's look at the other side and see how the other side deals with this argument saying that violent

86
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:10,790
video games are a negative thing for very young people.
