1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:07,020
Now let me just point out one thing quickly before we go on to how we can concede a point and that is

2
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:10,810
the power of analogies and basically how we do that.

3
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:17,040
I'm going to just give you a quick example and an explanation for what an analogy is basically an analogy

4
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:22,890
is a simplified example that helps people understand a more complex thing.

5
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:29,550
So if we're having a debate or a discussion about politics around the world or whatever and we're talking

6
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:35,540
about the United States and Canada let's say let's say we're talking about the United States and Canada.

7
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:40,560
Well things when we're talking about countries can be very complicated really complicated.

8
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:47,760
So we might make an analogy or a simplified example as a way to help people understand the picture.

9
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:50,040
I don't want to set up the whole debate here.

10
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:52,180
I don't even want to make a real point.

11
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:58,440
I just want to show you what an analogy is and how you could make one and they can be used everywhere

12
00:00:58,470 --> 00:01:05,280
in a debate because if you make things too complex too complicated then people who are listening to

13
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:08,460
the debate might become confused the audience.

14
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:13,960
If there is an audience will wonder what you're talking about because you can't explain your ideas simply.

15
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:17,310
So that's why analogies or simplified examples can help.

16
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:20,870
That's really what an analogy is a simplified example.

17
00:01:20,910 --> 00:01:26,760
So making examples is a powerful tool in helping the other people who are listening understand what

18
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:27,690
you mean.

19
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:29,220
So here's an analogy.

20
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:35,910
And this is how we can begin an analogy one way we can do this is to say Here's an analogy imagine there

21
00:01:35,910 --> 00:01:37,410
are two brothers.

22
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:41,590
One is big and confident and everyone knows about him.

23
00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:45,430
The other is more laid back and easier to get along with.

24
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:52,170
This is the relationship between Canada and the United States or this is the situation with Canada and

25
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:53,610
the United States.

26
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:56,510
Now I'm not sure if that's a great analogy.

27
00:01:56,520 --> 00:02:03,960
I don't really care about world politics that much but I'm just trying to say the view that people have

28
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:08,160
of countries and politics with countries that's very complicated.

29
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:14,790
But the idea of two brothers to help people understand something that's a lot simpler and people can

30
00:02:14,790 --> 00:02:17,790
understand the relationship between two brothers.

31
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:23,620
People can understand the characteristics of a person or two people side by side.

32
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:31,350
OK so I've used that simpler example to help you get an idea of the larger and more complicated point

33
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:32,760
I'm trying to make.

34
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:39,960
When you can use analogies if you can't make an analogy that's OK explain your point in more detail

35
00:02:39,990 --> 00:02:46,830
but could be a very useful way to get the audience on your side and to get them to understand you more

36
00:02:46,890 --> 00:02:49,160
easily than maybe the other side.
