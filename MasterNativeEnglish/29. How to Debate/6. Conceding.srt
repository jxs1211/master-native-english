1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:04,800
Sometimes you want to agree that the other side is right about something.

2
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:10,980
Whether you're having a regular conversation or a debate right maybe a part of what they're saying is

3
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:16,970
correct but they're not seeing the whole picture and you still think you're right about the whole picture.

4
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:24,060
Or maybe you want to agree with one point but say that maybe that point is not as important as this

5
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:24,670
point.

6
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:28,370
Whatever we need to be able to concede the point.

7
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:33,840
Sometimes that means we need to be able to show other people that we agree a little bit.

8
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:36,530
We agree but we need to say usually.

9
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:43,890
But OK we're not going to look at three expressions we can use to say OK what you said just now.

10
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:45,130
That's probably true.

11
00:00:45,150 --> 00:00:46,230
Maybe that's right.

12
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:54,390
However and then make another point that hopefully disagrees with with that point or shows that maybe

13
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:57,110
it doesn't matter if they're correct whatever.

14
00:00:57,150 --> 00:00:59,300
OK so let's look at these three phrases.

15
00:00:59,310 --> 00:01:07,580
There is no denying that alcoholism is a problem but OK so you're saying alcoholism is a major problem.

16
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:07,970
OK.

17
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:09,670
Well I don't disagree with that.

18
00:01:09,690 --> 00:01:12,540
There's no denying that alcoholism is a problem.

19
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:16,520
But OK so one side says we have to do something about this.

20
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:20,580
Decreasing the age is a terrible idea because it will increase this.

21
00:01:20,590 --> 00:01:21,580
This major issue.

22
00:01:21,610 --> 00:01:24,210
Well there's no denying that alcoholism is a problem.

23
00:01:24,230 --> 00:01:27,060
But is this the best solution I think.

24
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:27,660
Blah blah blah.

25
00:01:27,890 --> 00:01:28,390
OK.

26
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:30,930
So I'm giving the point to the person who said it.

27
00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:32,130
No disagreement.

28
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:37,610
It also is a way to help define where the agreement and disagreements are.

29
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:45,480
And this can be a really good way to clarify your point and clarify your position or your case or your

30
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:50,830
argument while you're right that many deaths have been caused by underage drinking.

31
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:51,020
OK.

32
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:52,490
So this would be on the other side.

33
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:56,380
Now maybe the other side has used the isn't it true.

34
00:01:56,630 --> 00:02:03,120
And I want to admit that it is but then I'm going to say something else while you're right that many

35
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:06,000
deaths have been caused by underage drinking.

36
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,110
I agree with that point.

37
00:02:07,650 --> 00:02:10,450
I also feel or I think.

38
00:02:10,570 --> 00:02:10,890
OK.

39
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:12,290
And then say something else.

40
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:13,830
I don't know what that point would be.

41
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:20,670
But the point is to learn this expression in this way to agree to that point and then move on and focus

42
00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:21,690
on something else.

43
00:02:21,690 --> 00:02:27,600
This can be a really good way to focus on another point even though that point is a very good point

44
00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:33,220
and not really answer it directly or spend a lot of time talking about that point.

45
00:02:33,390 --> 00:02:41,970
The other one is I'll admit that alcoholism hasn't declined much but so one person has said well listen

46
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:47,360
the drinking age at 21 it's not working very well because alcoholism is the same.

47
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:48,060
See.

48
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:55,950
Well I'll admit that alcoholism hasn't changed that much but but then I can make another point either

49
00:02:56,190 --> 00:03:02,280
a point that contradicts or disagrees with what you just said or to show that maybe something else is

50
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:09,150
more important or to kind of shift focus and change the topics a little bit and focus on something else

51
00:03:09,210 --> 00:03:11,220
a stronger point that I have.

52
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:17,430
So this is sort of a way to fight against some of the phrases that we learned earlier on in the lesson.

53
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:18,840
Very useful as well.

54
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:19,150
OK.

55
00:03:19,190 --> 00:03:26,910
So these are the ways that we can first make points make arguments and poke holes in another person's

56
00:03:26,910 --> 00:03:27,630
case.

57
00:03:27,630 --> 00:03:34,980
And then also how we can fight against or avoid really focusing on the points that other people have

58
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:35,550
made.

59
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:42,360
So hopefully these three ways of giving the other side a point come in handy or are useful to you when

60
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:46,320
you're disagreeing with someone who has a very good point.

61
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:51,060
Next we're going to talk about how we can actually debate a topic.
