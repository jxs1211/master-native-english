1
00:00:04,020 --> 00:00:09,000
In the last lesson we talked about how to describe data how to describe graphs.

2
00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:12,390
In this lesson we're going to focus on debates.

3
00:00:12,390 --> 00:00:18,620
Debate is when two sides disagree on something and they need to argue their side or make a case.

4
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:23,760
We're going to work on some useful phrases we're going to talk about the purpose of a debate we're going

5
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:26,330
to talk about how we can make a point.

6
00:00:26,370 --> 00:00:31,400
Use analogies and also concede a point and then we're going to look at a real example.

7
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:34,590
Two sides of a debate issue.

8
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:37,470
So I hope you've enjoyed the course up to this point.

9
00:00:37,470 --> 00:00:39,360
This will be our last full lesson.

10
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:44,220
Hope you've noticed that my hair has gotten longer throughout the course and I wonder if you've asked

11
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:44,880
yourself.

12
00:00:44,970 --> 00:00:51,270
I wonder how many times he's had to wash this shirt and this shirt during the course.

13
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:54,450
The answer is probably about 15.

14
00:00:54,450 --> 00:01:00,390
I've been shooting this course over the last couple months in fact and I've tried to make my appearance

15
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:03,710
about the same throughout the course to make it consistent.

16
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:05,410
So I hope you've enjoyed the course.

17
00:01:05,550 --> 00:01:10,170
I hope you've got a lot out of it to this point and I hope that once we're finished with this course

18
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:15,060
you can go out there and actually use all of the stuff that you've learned.

19
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:20,460
Anyway let's get started with our last full lesson on how to debate.
