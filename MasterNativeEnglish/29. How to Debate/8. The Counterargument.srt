1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:08,310
All right so let's look at the counter argument to the idea that video games are bad or do have a negative

2
00:00:08,310 --> 00:00:09,750
effect on young people.

3
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:11,920
So now the answer is No.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:18,510
And this is our counter which means against or opposite argument argument.

5
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:22,820
OK now we're going to use some of the expressions we've learned so look out for those.

6
00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:24,200
If that were true.

7
00:00:24,270 --> 00:00:31,740
Remember the previous person said that there is an effect of being very impressionable and so kids will

8
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:32,870
learn that behavior.

9
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:39,690
If that were true little kids would be would be running around outside right now with knives and guns

10
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:42,480
because violent video games are everywhere.

11
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:42,630
OK.

12
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:45,690
Because anybody can play violent video games.

13
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:48,030
Many kids play them any way we know that.

14
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:49,020
That's a fact.

15
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:53,970
If what you're saying were true then we would see violence all over the place.

16
00:00:53,970 --> 00:00:58,130
We would have little kids running around stabbing people and shooting people.

17
00:00:58,130 --> 00:00:59,340
That's the interesting point.

18
00:00:59,340 --> 00:00:59,750
Right.

19
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:07,920
OK remember what we do here is we show either we ask the question why to show either why what you're

20
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:14,520
saying is not true because this is true or we're saying if what you're saying were true this thing should

21
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:15,720
be true but it's not.

22
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:19,250
In fact we don't see kids running around with knives and guns.

23
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:22,770
So that means what you're saying is probably not true.

24
00:01:22,780 --> 00:01:23,390
OK.

25
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:26,370
Because violent video games are everywhere.

26
00:01:26,370 --> 00:01:28,380
There's certainly no denying.

27
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:34,640
Now remember this is the way that we can agree with another person's point and then change the focus.

28
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:35,850
The point was.

29
00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:37,080
Isn't it true.

30
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:40,440
Isn't it true that young people are more impressionable.

31
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:42,120
There's no denying.

32
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:42,690
Here we are.

33
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:47,450
There's no denying that young people are more impressionable than adults.

34
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:47,740
OK.

35
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:49,230
So I'm giving you that point.

36
00:01:49,230 --> 00:01:50,250
That's true.

37
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:50,940
That's true.

38
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:58,300
But they are also clearly capable of distinguishing real life from video games.

39
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:03,690
So I'm saying yes they're impressionable but they can tell the difference to distinguish means to be

40
00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:08,310
able to tell the difference if you can distinguish between different types of coffee.

41
00:02:08,430 --> 00:02:10,050
That means you can tell the difference.

42
00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:13,950
All of this one is from Colombia and this one is from Africa for example.

43
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:14,320
OK.

44
00:02:14,370 --> 00:02:18,430
They're capable or able to distinguish real life from video games.

45
00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:24,160
The rules of the game are to shoot and kill the rules of the game or to shoot and kill.

46
00:02:24,270 --> 00:02:27,590
If you do those things you win in real life.

47
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:32,340
If you do those things you lose lose maybe means you know go to jail or something.

48
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:34,080
Kids aren't stupid.

49
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:37,750
It's up to parents to teach kids what is right and wrong.

50
00:02:37,770 --> 00:02:43,770
So on this side it's saying hey what you're saying is not right because if what you're saying were true

51
00:02:43,770 --> 00:02:46,350
you'd have kids running around with guns.

52
00:02:46,350 --> 00:02:49,530
In fact kids can tell the difference in a game.

53
00:02:49,530 --> 00:02:51,090
You have to kill in real life.

54
00:02:51,090 --> 00:02:52,920
You can't do that in a game.

55
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:54,360
Violence is good in real life.

56
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:55,080
It's not.

57
00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:58,320
It's up to parents to teach kids what is right and what is wrong.

58
00:02:58,320 --> 00:02:59,210
Kids aren't stupid.

59
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:04,710
They're able to tell the difference between this game and out there in real life.

60
00:03:04,710 --> 00:03:08,070
The rules that you have to play to maybe succeed.

61
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:08,420
OK.

62
00:03:08,450 --> 00:03:13,490
So this is just a counter argument to the previous one and this could go back and forth.

63
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:19,230
We could do another one but notice we have used some of the expressions that we learned earlier on in

64
00:03:19,230 --> 00:03:20,000
this lesson.

65
00:03:20,010 --> 00:03:27,810
Now I hope that you have a feeling for how debates go now and that you could if you had to then go on

66
00:03:27,810 --> 00:03:34,170
and support one side or the other and give more reasons why either violent video games are very negative

67
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:37,290
or why violent video games are no problem.

68
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:40,890
Hopefully you could use some of the expressions we've learned to do that.

69
00:03:40,890 --> 00:03:48,270
But I'm going to give you another topic to work on as an assignment and I want you to make sure to use

70
00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:51,740
these expressions and use the things we learned in this lesson.

71
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:52,700
To do that.

72
00:03:52,770 --> 00:04:00,320
Now to practice this what I'd like you to do is as usual record yourself actually doing both sides of

73
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:00,900
a debate.

74
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:05,010
Both sides of the debate play devil's advocate with yourself.

75
00:04:05,010 --> 00:04:06,140
Make sure to record it.

76
00:04:06,430 --> 00:04:09,220
OK give as much detail as you can.

77
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:16,290
Make analogies if you can to help clarify things to your audience which may be yourself and make sure

78
00:04:16,290 --> 00:04:23,820
to use the expressions that we learned in this lesson the debate topic is medical testing on animals

79
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:25,740
is right or wrong.

80
00:04:25,770 --> 00:04:32,260
That means we should test medicine new medicines on animals like rats or we should not.

81
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:32,500
OK.

82
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:38,880
And there are a lot of different reasons why we should maybe and why we shouldn't try to explore those

83
00:04:39,210 --> 00:04:42,120
and explore also the expressions we learned.

84
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:45,810
So good luck with that and I will see you in the next video.
