1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:04,260
Now just for fun let's try to analyze this graph a little bit.

2
00:00:04,260 --> 00:00:08,390
Let's take the trends that we can see and talk about what they might mean.

3
00:00:08,430 --> 00:00:16,740
The most obvious thing is that there is that sharp decline and also the fact that in poor countries

4
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:25,230
with a very low GDP the fertility rate is extremely high much much higher than in countries that tend

5
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:28,420
to have a higher GDP per capita.

6
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:36,090
That's quite shocking it's not a small difference almost nine over here and only one or two on the other

7
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:37,050
side.

8
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:37,830
Why is that.

9
00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:40,610
That's the interesting thing that I would want to analyze.

10
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:42,460
So this is just an example.

11
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:47,760
And notice that I'm going to put phrases in here that make it clear that it's my opinion or I'm just

12
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:54,180
guessing that it's not extra research I'm doing I'm just kind of thinking about it and wondering why

13
00:00:54,330 --> 00:01:00,750
and I'm using some language in here that lets you know that I am just doing my own analysis and giving

14
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:06,630
my own opinion since many people in poor countries are Farmers having more children means having more

15
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:14,190
workers to do manual labor manual laborers often work with your hands like farm work which means the

16
00:01:14,190 --> 00:01:16,190
farm can be more successful.

17
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:21,960
That means I'm guessing I'm guessing that in countries that are poor maybe people want to have more

18
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:29,730
children because if they have more children those children can work and if they can all work then the

19
00:01:29,730 --> 00:01:32,030
farm can be more successful just guessing.

20
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:40,440
I think the fertility rate is also high due to poor living conditions and insufficient insufficient

21
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:46,470
means not good enough not sufficient sufficient means it's enough it's enough sometimes if something

22
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:52,260
is enough we say well that's sufficient although that's quite formal insufficient not enough due to

23
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:58,950
insufficient basic health care and nutrition in third world countries third world countries we're usually

24
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:01,680
talking about countries that are quite poor.

25
00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:09,180
So I know that in many third world countries in some places not all places there are poor conditions

26
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:10,440
living conditions.

27
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:18,390
And in fact maybe people are hungry sometimes starving sometimes there is disease and because maybe

28
00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:24,840
Babies can't eat enough or there's no basic health care you have high mortality which is very sad.

29
00:02:25,170 --> 00:02:27,840
But again I'm just guessing here.

30
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:35,700
I'm just guessing that because because high mortality is caused by the poor living conditions maybe

31
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:38,610
women need to have more children to compensate.

32
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:45,150
So if you have high mortality then maybe you need to have more babies to meet to that and balance it.

33
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:51,090
We can say compensate to compensate for something is if you have too much of this you need to do more

34
00:02:51,090 --> 00:02:53,000
of this just to make it balanced.

35
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:53,440
OK.

36
00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:58,890
I think the fertility rate is also high due to poor living conditions and insufficient basic health

37
00:02:58,890 --> 00:03:01,690
care and nutrition in third world countries.

38
00:03:01,710 --> 00:03:05,750
It tells me again this is a phrase that lets you know it's my opinion.

39
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:09,270
It tells me that infant mortality is high.

40
00:03:10,050 --> 00:03:16,820
So I'm just saying in many cases young babies infants die because they don't have enough nutrition.

41
00:03:17,070 --> 00:03:19,170
Tells me that infant mortality is high.

42
00:03:19,170 --> 00:03:22,140
Women need to have more children just to compensate.

43
00:03:22,230 --> 00:03:24,530
It's really tragic tragic means.

44
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:26,670
It's very sad it's a terrible thing.

45
00:03:26,670 --> 00:03:32,970
Perhaps in developed countries developed countries are countries that maybe have a higher standard of

46
00:03:32,970 --> 00:03:39,040
living or maybe a higher GDP per capita perhaps in developed countries like Canada or the UK.

47
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:47,030
The average number of children per woman is low due to the high cost of raising and educating children.

48
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:50,230
Now that one I can say more confidently.

49
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:56,130
I mean I can still use the word perhaps perhaps lets you know that it is a guess and that's just my

50
00:03:56,130 --> 00:03:56,730
opinion.

51
00:03:56,760 --> 00:04:04,050
Notice I'm using things like I think and perhaps and it tells me to give you a feeling of yeah this

52
00:04:04,050 --> 00:04:06,400
is just my view my opinion.

53
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:12,830
But still I can be a little more confident about that end thing because I can see it around me right.

54
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:16,310
I know how expensive it is to have kids here.

55
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:19,840
You have to send them to school and it's cost a lot of money.

56
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:20,200
OK.

57
00:04:20,340 --> 00:04:26,760
So the average number of children per woman is low due to because of the high cost of raising and educating

58
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:27,420
children.

59
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:31,830
OK so that's just one way to analyze when you're doing the analysis.

60
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:40,100
I would recommend using those phrases to show that it is subjective and don't just state your opinion.

61
00:04:40,140 --> 00:04:45,680
Make sure you're referencing the data you're referencing the graph you're talking about countries with

62
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:46,530
a low GDP.

63
00:04:46,530 --> 00:04:52,080
Countries with a higher GDP you're talking about what you've just described and having that link is

64
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:57,540
very important because if there is no link or connection between your analysis and the original data

65
00:04:57,570 --> 00:05:00,760
and the graph then people might begin to feel confused.

66
00:05:00,930 --> 00:05:07,440
So maybe this is a little bit difficult but I encourage you to try this out a few times.

67
00:05:07,470 --> 00:05:12,990
And if you get used to it I think you'll find that it's actually interesting to try to analyze graphs

68
00:05:12,990 --> 00:05:14,900
and see why is it this way.

69
00:05:14,910 --> 00:05:17,110
Why is this data like this.

70
00:05:17,130 --> 00:05:21,410
Also if you can describe this clearly you will be the hero at meetings.

71
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:27,870
You'll be able to clearly communicate things that might not be that easy for some other people to communicate

72
00:05:27,930 --> 00:05:33,480
and that will make you a very powerful speaker as always of course it's very important to practice and

73
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:35,250
practice makes perfect.

74
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:38,500
Good also say perfect practice makes perfect.

75
00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:44,820
What I'd like you to do is find a graph or some sort of data visualization based on your interest or

76
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:49,980
based on your career perhaps and then describe it describe the data points.

77
00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:52,250
Talk about what the whole thing looks like.

78
00:05:52,350 --> 00:05:58,030
And again imagine that you're talking to someone who cannot see it then give a simple analysis.

79
00:05:58,050 --> 00:06:04,770
Make sure to use subjective phrases to show that it's your opinion but also make sure to reference things

80
00:06:05,010 --> 00:06:08,600
from the graph or the chart or whatever it is you're looking at.

81
00:06:08,670 --> 00:06:14,220
Practice this record it and then go back and listen to it and see if you can correct yourself.

82
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:14,700
Good luck.

83
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:17,160
I'll see you in the next lesson.
