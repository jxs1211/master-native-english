1
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:10,020
In the last lesson we talked about different phrases we can use when we're picking somebody up at the

2
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:11,010
airport.

3
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:19,500
Very important social situation in this lesson we're going to talk about how to describe data in graphs.

4
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:26,970
So usually when we express or want to show a large amount of data which means information and communicate

5
00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:33,090
that to someone we don't just say all of the different numbers or all of the different facts that we

6
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:41,880
want to say we represent it or show it in a graph or a chart or some type of we could say visualization

7
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:47,510
visualization is a way to show something in a way that people can see right.

8
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:49,520
So that people can easily understand it.

9
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:52,550
Maybe they can understand it in a more intuitive way.

10
00:00:52,560 --> 00:01:01,800
Well let's say you're in a meeting and you want to communicate what you're seeing in a chart or a graph

11
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:04,780
because maybe there's somebody on the phone.

12
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:11,040
It's important to be able to express information simply and say what you're looking at.

13
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:14,310
Now we've we've worked on that early in this course.

14
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,360
We talked about for example the House.

15
00:01:16,430 --> 00:01:17,330
So we described that.

16
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:19,170
But what about when it's a graph.

17
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:24,900
Well in this lesson we're going to be focused on how we can do that how we can express what we're looking

18
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:27,030
at a data visualization.

19
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:29,720
Now this may sound very difficult.

20
00:01:29,730 --> 00:01:36,510
The best way I think for me to show you a way to do this is to do an example.

21
00:01:36,510 --> 00:01:43,140
So what we're going to do is we're going to look at a look at a graph and we're going to then talk about

22
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:43,860
what it means.

23
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:50,730
First we're gonna go through some keywords some useful some useful words then we're going to actually

24
00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:55,910
look at the graph and we're going to talk about how we can describe what's going on there.

25
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:57,460
I'm going to give you a clear example.

26
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:06,540
Then we'll go over a few phrases we can use to express an analysis of that what it means really if we

27
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:09,120
start asking deeper questions.

28
00:02:09,130 --> 00:02:15,250
Now this part is actually the more challenging part but also I think the more the more interesting part.

29
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:19,530
So let's get started with some of the vocabulary and then we will look at the graph.
