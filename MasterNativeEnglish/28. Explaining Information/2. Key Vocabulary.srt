1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:05,130
Now some of these things that we're going to look at will make a little bit more sense once we actually

2
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:06,460
look at the graph.

3
00:00:06,570 --> 00:00:12,180
But I just want to go over some of the basic words we need to know before we get into that description.

4
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:21,060
So first one analysis or analysis is a noun analyze is the verb form analysis means you study something

5
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:25,710
and then you decide what it could mean and you interpret it.

6
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:28,160
You don't just look at it and say what's there.

7
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:32,130
You look at it maybe say what's there and then ask yourself.

8
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:34,750
So what does this tell me about the world.

9
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:36,930
What does this tell me about this topic.

10
00:00:36,990 --> 00:00:38,260
Whatever it may be.

11
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:45,390
So analysis kind of means studying something more deeply thinking about something more deeply and telling

12
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:50,760
yourself or telling others what it actually means on a higher level.

13
00:00:50,790 --> 00:00:57,960
So you would look at data study data analyzed data and then hopefully come to a higher or better understanding

14
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:00,550
of the topic or your own opinion maybe.

15
00:01:00,620 --> 00:01:01,280
OK.

16
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:04,330
Now fertility this might not make sense.

17
00:01:04,380 --> 00:01:06,400
Now why am I talking about this.

18
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:11,340
But this just means it's related to birth women giving birth.

19
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:14,490
We're going to look at a graph that shows fertility.

20
00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:16,870
That means the number of babies born.

21
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:18,810
How many babies are born.

22
00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:26,280
So when we hear things like fertility rate we're talking about usually how many children women give

23
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:29,470
birth to maybe in a country maybe in a city.

24
00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:31,070
What's the fertility rate.

25
00:01:31,230 --> 00:01:36,640
And that's going to be an average case on average an average.

26
00:01:36,870 --> 00:01:42,180
I think you know it in averages if you add them all together and divide by the total number you have

27
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:44,110
the average fertility rate.

28
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:53,590
OK trends now a trend is usually a way to talk about the direction that something is happening in.

29
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:57,270
Now one way to talk about a trend is to is to discuss fashion.

30
00:01:57,300 --> 00:01:58,560
Oh very cool right now.

31
00:01:58,590 --> 00:01:59,940
This is a trend.

32
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,420
This is a trend but you could also talk about trends like this.

33
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:10,620
Well every summer maybe the price of this type of clothing gets more expensive and it happens every

34
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:11,280
year.

35
00:02:11,450 --> 00:02:13,350
So it didn't just happen once.

36
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:13,580
OK.

37
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:14,670
So that's a trend.

38
00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:21,660
So something happens on a more regular basis or happens more frequently or it's easy to predict that

39
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:22,850
it will happen again.

40
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:24,870
Usually we use this word.

41
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:28,070
It's used also in the fashion sense too.

42
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:30,780
They're related but not exactly the same.

43
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:31,570
OK.

44
00:02:31,710 --> 00:02:38,900
So analysis fertility by the way the opposite of fertility just to mention that quickly is mortality.

45
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:43,500
Mortality is related to the opposite of birth which is death.

46
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:48,780
So if you ever hear someone say high mortality you're talking about a lot of people dying.

47
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:50,360
GDP per capita.

48
00:02:50,390 --> 00:02:59,520
Now I guess you probably know GDP this is gross domestic product and this represents basically how wealthy

49
00:02:59,550 --> 00:03:00,660
a country is.

50
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:04,220
Sometimes you'll see GDP per capita.

51
00:03:04,230 --> 00:03:05,380
Don't be confused.

52
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:07,220
It's pretty simple actually.

53
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:15,240
Let's imagine that let's imagine that in a year a country makes 1000 dollars.

54
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:18,650
Let's say this country has 1000 people.

55
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:22,160
So the GDP per capita is 1.

56
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:29,530
So basically all you do is you take the total GDP and you divide by the total number of people.

57
00:03:29,550 --> 00:03:31,940
Then you have the GDP per capita.

58
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:38,130
So on average how much money does each person have in a year.

59
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:39,960
Basically that's GDP per capita.

60
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:45,270
And some people say it's not a good way to judge how much money people have because you could have five

61
00:03:45,270 --> 00:03:49,760
people with billions of dollars and a million people with ten dollars.

62
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:50,220
Right.

63
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:53,940
So maybe not the best way to talk about how much money everybody has.

64
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:58,260
But it's a it's a way to measure the wealth.

65
00:03:58,340 --> 00:04:02,810
You could say the wealth or status of a country's economy.

66
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:05,420
OK decline and drop.

67
00:04:05,610 --> 00:04:12,690
Now if you see something going down there's less of something less money less people whatever it may

68
00:04:12,690 --> 00:04:13,450
be.

69
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:17,340
We often say there is a decline in that.

70
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:24,180
For example recently we've seen a decline in violence a decline in violence.

71
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:27,080
Violence means maybe crime where people get hurt.

72
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:27,770
OK.

73
00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:28,060
Why.

74
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:29,430
Oh maybe there I don't know.

75
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:30,750
Maybe there are more police.

76
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:32,530
Maybe that culture is changing.

77
00:04:32,550 --> 00:04:39,000
Whatever it may be there is a decline in violence but that doesn't tell us how quickly that's happening

78
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:45,270
it may be over 10 years unless we say how long that is we could say over a six year period there was

79
00:04:45,270 --> 00:04:48,580
a major decline in violence.

80
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:49,130
OK.

81
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:56,390
If it's sudden though then we'll probably use the word drop and we might even say a sharp a sharp drop.

82
00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:01,930
It's if it's sudden if you look at a graph and it goes straight down sharp decline you could say that

83
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:06,970
or a sharp drop or a drop doesn't have to be over a period of time.

84
00:05:06,970 --> 00:05:07,840
It could be.

85
00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:13,450
Well anything on a graph that goes like this you could say a sharp drop in the opposite of that would

86
00:05:13,450 --> 00:05:14,830
be rise.

87
00:05:14,830 --> 00:05:19,420
A sharp rise in crime a sharp rise in income.

88
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:23,560
How much money people make for example sharp suggests it looks like this.

89
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:25,440
The line in the graph looks like this.

90
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:29,400
So I think this will make more sense once we actually look at the graph.

91
00:05:29,410 --> 00:05:30,600
Let's just take a look at it.

92
00:05:30,610 --> 00:05:34,990
Talk about what it means then we'll look at how we can actually describe it.
