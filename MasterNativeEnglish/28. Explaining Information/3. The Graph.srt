1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:05,990
All right so let's look at the graph and I'm going to ask you to remember it because well remember the

2
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:07,880
the basic idea of it.

3
00:00:07,890 --> 00:00:13,650
Because I'm going to get rid of it to go over the example of how we describe it because I don't have

4
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:15,170
that much room on the screen.

5
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:15,940
OK.

6
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:22,570
So total fertility rate that means the number of babies born and GDP per capita.

7
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:23,580
We know what that means.

8
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:24,110
OK.

9
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:30,940
Now here we have on this graph we have the total fertility rate over here.

10
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:36,930
That means the number of children per woman in what those cities states.

11
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:37,380
What.

12
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:39,430
Well there is Saudi Arabia.

13
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:40,730
There's Israel.

14
00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:43,040
So it's going it's going to be countries.

15
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:44,300
It's gonna be countries.

16
00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:46,650
So they each dot is a country.

17
00:00:46,650 --> 00:00:50,980
We can know that because we see that these two dots are countries.

18
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:57,000
And maybe you can look up where your country is what is the GDP per capita of your country.

19
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,790
What is the fertility rate of your country.

20
00:00:59,810 --> 00:01:01,940
Maybe interesting to look up to research.

21
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:03,180
Look up means research.

22
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:03,580
OK.

23
00:01:03,630 --> 00:01:07,530
So and by the way I'm just getting this information from the internet.

24
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:10,270
If it's incorrect for some reason I apologize.

25
00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:16,700
But we're using it for the example to describe the data because we need to know how to do this.

26
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:20,130
All right now we have the fertility rate here and on the.

27
00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:21,800
That's called the y axis.

28
00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:30,060
And on the x axis y axis on the x axis we have the GDP per capita.

29
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:33,750
And this is in U.S. dollars and the year we can see is two thousand four.

30
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:36,840
So this information comes from two thousand four.

31
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:45,750
So we have here we could say very very poor countries low GDP per capita wealthier countries up to 40.

32
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:50,790
Looks like about forty one thousand dollars GDP per capita.

33
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:57,880
And then on the side of the poor countries you have generally higher fertility rate.

34
00:01:57,990 --> 00:02:01,460
That means more women are having more babies.

35
00:02:01,470 --> 00:02:01,800
OK.

36
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:04,250
Women are having more babies on average.

37
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:14,790
And then you can see a sharp drop or a sharp decline in the number of babies that women have as the

38
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:17,840
GDP per capita increases.

39
00:02:17,850 --> 00:02:22,860
Now if that's complicated and you can understand what I'm saying don't worry we're going to go over

40
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:28,860
it in text I'm going to read through the example that I've made to describe this and hopefully it will

41
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:29,950
be very clear.

42
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:37,770
I'm using this as a way to show you the language we can use to describe visualizations to describe charts

43
00:02:37,770 --> 00:02:38,840
graphs data.

44
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:39,150
OK.

45
00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:46,300
So I hope I hope you can sort of take a mental picture of this and notice the trend here.

46
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:51,120
Notice that these countries are the poorer countries the wealthier countries over here.

47
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:54,720
Notice that we have two countries here in the middle.

48
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:58,210
And notice these numbers of nine at the top here.

49
00:02:58,290 --> 00:03:02,980
Forty five thousand at the top or at the farthest end over here.

50
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:03,370
OK.

51
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:04,860
So take a mental picture.

52
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:05,360
Ready.

53
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:06,840
One two three.

54
00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:07,380
All right.

55
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:10,840
Let's now go on and talk about how we can describe this.

56
00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:12,110
No analysis yet.

57
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:18,050
We're not going to talk about what it means yet but we're going to talk about how to describe it clearly.
