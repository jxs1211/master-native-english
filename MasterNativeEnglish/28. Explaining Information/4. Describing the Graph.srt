1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:05,010
Now let's get into the actual description of this graph of this data.

2
00:00:05,010 --> 00:00:11,760
Remember our goal is to help someone who's hypothetically on the phone in our meeting visualize what

3
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:12,410
we are seeing.

4
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:13,410
They can't see it.

5
00:00:13,470 --> 00:00:14,380
We can see it.

6
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:17,370
We need to make it clear what it is we're seeing.

7
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:22,760
The first sentence just like our previous description class is is very important.

8
00:00:22,770 --> 00:00:28,200
Now we don't need to use so many adjectives because we want to be as clear and simple as possible but

9
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:36,630
we do need to very clearly state what the relationship is between the Y and the x axis.

10
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:38,300
That's probably the most important.

11
00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:46,050
Once we say that then we can go into some trends that we see and we can talk about the shapes the structure

12
00:00:46,290 --> 00:00:48,300
of the points on the graph.

13
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:50,450
So let's let's look at it.

14
00:00:50,490 --> 00:00:59,670
This graph shows the relationship between the total fertility rate or children per woman the total fertility

15
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:05,370
rate in countries around the world and the GDP per capita of those countries.

16
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:13,350
In 2004 there was a sharp drop in the fertility rate of poor countries between 0 and about five thousand

17
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:14,090
dollars.

18
00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:20,280
GDP per capita when the GDP is low the fertility rate tends to be high.

19
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:25,740
In general wealthy countries tend to have fewer children per woman.

20
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:30,540
Or we could say have a lower fertility rate.

21
00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:38,070
There are far more countries near the lower end of the graph in terms of GDP and relatively few at the

22
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:39,080
higher end.

23
00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:41,090
We don't actually have to say that last part.

24
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:47,670
We could leave it out because if there are the majority in the lower end then that means that there

25
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:49,670
aren't that many in the higher end.

26
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:49,900
OK.

27
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:55,550
Remember there are a few over here in the wealthier countries and a lot of them over here.

28
00:01:55,560 --> 00:02:02,250
OK but sometimes it helps just to be extra clear to state exactly what you're seeing even if it might

29
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:03,510
be a little redundant.

30
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:04,040
OK.

31
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:07,380
Let's just go through that one more time with a little bit more breakdown.

32
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:10,720
The graph shows that means this is what I'm looking at.

33
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:12,510
This is what it's telling me.

34
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:15,750
We can't say tells we have to say shows shows.

35
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:16,180
OK.

36
00:02:16,350 --> 00:02:18,660
You could say I can see on the graph.

37
00:02:18,690 --> 00:02:20,960
But I think this is probably a better way.

38
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:24,390
The graph shows keyword there.

39
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:25,500
The relationship.

40
00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:29,400
That's the best word to use when we're talking about two things.

41
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:32,640
You and me we're talking about the relationship between us.

42
00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:39,380
We're talking about a Y in an X we're talking about the relationship between the Y and the X relationship

43
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:41,810
means they have some connection to each other.

44
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:42,240
Right.

45
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:45,320
It suggests that they're not completely independent.

46
00:02:45,330 --> 00:02:47,820
That means if you change one you change the other.

47
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:49,330
That's what relationship means.

48
00:02:49,350 --> 00:02:55,560
Doesn't just mean that I'm putting them on this graph it means hey there's something here a correlation

49
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:58,210
that we can talk about we can discuss.

50
00:02:58,250 --> 00:02:58,580
OK.

51
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:01,920
This graph shows the relationship between the total fertility rate.

52
00:03:01,950 --> 00:03:05,960
Now if you want to say the number of children per woman.

53
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:06,860
That's OK.

54
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:08,760
You can say the number of children per woman.

55
00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:15,870
If you're simplifying it but because you actually see fertility rate on the graph it's better to use

56
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:18,830
that term better to use what you see.

57
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:19,340
OK.

58
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:23,820
If you want to clarify something though all you have to do is add or.

59
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:26,120
And then say the other way to say it.

60
00:03:26,130 --> 00:03:32,860
Total fertility rate or number of children born per woman in countries around the world.

61
00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:33,320
OK.

62
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,450
We could say all countries around the world.

63
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:38,250
But actually we don't know if it's all countries.

64
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:40,710
It probably is but it doesn't really say that.

65
00:03:40,710 --> 00:03:45,770
Does it and the GDP per capita of those countries.

66
00:03:45,810 --> 00:03:50,460
So that helps us make it clear that the relationship is between this and this.

67
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:56,400
We're not talking about different countries makes it very clear we use those to reference to talk about

68
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:59,020
the previous countries that we said OK.

69
00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:04,440
Then we just say the date in 2004 when did this data come out.

70
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:06,170
Basically we don't know.

71
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:10,050
We don't know when exactly they did the study when they got the information.

72
00:04:10,050 --> 00:04:13,010
But this comes out in 2004.

73
00:04:13,010 --> 00:04:14,900
That's that's the year we have.

74
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:15,600
OK.

75
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:22,920
There is a sharp drop in the fertility rate of poor countries between 0 and about five thousand dollars.

76
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:25,200
Because if you remember it's shaped like this.

77
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:29,220
We need to help that person on the phone visualize this.

78
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:35,610
If we say there is a gradual a gradual decline the feeling will be like this.

79
00:04:35,610 --> 00:04:40,320
If we say sharp decline that's still not so clear because it could be like that it could be like that

80
00:04:40,350 --> 00:04:41,190
could be like that.

81
00:04:41,550 --> 00:04:49,950
So if we say numbers even if it's about we help clarify OK we can say around 5000.

82
00:04:49,950 --> 00:04:57,090
Between 0 and around five thousand or about five thousand GDP if we wanted to add the highest number

83
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:02,060
we could say the highest is around forty one thousand dollars.

84
00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:03,390
That's OK too.

85
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:05,810
If we don't need to say that then we can leave it out.

86
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:09,310
We're still just trying to describe basically what we see here.

87
00:05:09,390 --> 00:05:11,240
When the GDP is low.

88
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:17,070
Now we're talking about this not quite analysis but we are talking about a specific trend that we can

89
00:05:17,070 --> 00:05:17,640
see.

90
00:05:17,730 --> 00:05:24,400
We're talking about what happens when this thing happens when the GDP is low.

91
00:05:24,450 --> 00:05:28,240
The fertility rate tends to be high.

92
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:29,460
That is a trend.

93
00:05:29,550 --> 00:05:33,540
So if there is a trend we often use the word tend to describe it.

94
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:41,590
It is a trend that when the GDP is low the fertility rate is high it tends to be high.

95
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:44,190
So don't be confused between trend and trend.

96
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:50,660
There used to usually talk about the same kind of thing tends to be high in general in general.

97
00:05:50,670 --> 00:05:53,570
That helps us say well it's not always true.

98
00:05:53,610 --> 00:05:56,740
Maybe I don't know but it seems to be true.

99
00:05:56,820 --> 00:06:03,360
It looks to me like when the country is wealthier when there's more money or the GDP is higher then

100
00:06:03,510 --> 00:06:05,070
there are not that many children.

101
00:06:05,070 --> 00:06:06,200
That's interesting.

102
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:06,450
OK.

103
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:11,020
But we can use in general to say I'm not saying everyone is like this.

104
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:13,790
I'm just trying to communicate what I see here.

105
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:17,690
In general wealthy countries tend to have fewer children per woman.

106
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:18,220
OK.

107
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:23,900
Or we could say fertility rate in general wealthy countries tend to have a lower fertility rate.

108
00:06:23,910 --> 00:06:24,350
Same thing.

109
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:30,050
There are former move but there are far more countries near the lower end of the graph.

110
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:33,000
So we could talk about the high end and the low end.

111
00:06:33,030 --> 00:06:34,440
What does that mean exactly.

112
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:42,870
Well usually when we say and we're talking about the x axis not the y axis usually usually and the low

113
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:44,640
end will be closer to zero.

114
00:06:44,670 --> 00:06:46,450
The high end will be the higher number.

115
00:06:46,470 --> 00:06:51,440
That's very useful phrase the low end and the high end very useful.

116
00:06:51,510 --> 00:06:57,550
This is to help us talk about a maybe a spectrum member from here to here.

117
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:57,800
OK.

118
00:06:57,810 --> 00:07:03,420
So there are far more countries near the low or lower end of the graph in terms of GDP.

119
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:11,610
Now in terms of is to help us clarify which exact thing we're talking about in terms of wealth in terms

120
00:07:11,610 --> 00:07:14,740
of children per woman in terms of what.

121
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:21,840
So if we want to clarify exactly what it is that is this way at the low end it's going to be GDP per

122
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:29,070
capita in terms of you can use to talk about well this is my topic but in terms of wealth yeah maybe

123
00:07:29,130 --> 00:07:31,430
maybe this country is doing quite well.

124
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:37,050
But in terms of equality not so well and in terms of nutrition.

125
00:07:37,050 --> 00:07:38,210
Again not so well.

126
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:44,310
But in terms of the quality of entertainment then you can talk about whatever you want to talk about

127
00:07:44,370 --> 00:07:51,900
to say if something is good or bad in a specific place I love to visit for example I love to visit San

128
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:55,270
Francisco in terms of interesting things to do.

129
00:07:55,290 --> 00:07:56,250
It's awesome.

130
00:07:56,310 --> 00:08:05,100
But in terms of maybe cost it's not so awesome it's very expensive in terms of cost and relatively few

131
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:05,970
at the higher end.

132
00:08:05,970 --> 00:08:08,940
So this is a very simple way to describe this graph.

133
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:16,020
We could add more we could talk about the highest country being at around 41000 1000 GDP per capita.

134
00:08:16,050 --> 00:08:21,780
We could include that if we wanted to do that we would say simply the highest country or the country

135
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:30,330
with the highest GDP per capita is at around forty one thousand dollars and the average children per

136
00:08:30,330 --> 00:08:33,720
woman there is about two.

137
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:34,170
OK.

138
00:08:34,170 --> 00:08:36,290
So if we want to say that we certainly can.

139
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:42,890
Saying what's at the end might be useful in some cases so that it's clear what is the highest number.

140
00:08:42,930 --> 00:08:44,070
Sometimes that can help.

141
00:08:44,430 --> 00:08:51,390
So I hope from this description you can pick out some of the useful phrases that we can use to talk

142
00:08:51,390 --> 00:08:58,110
about graphs and always imagine that even if it's not the situation imagine that you're describing it

143
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:02,610
to someone who can't see it that will force you to use very clear language.

144
00:09:02,610 --> 00:09:08,340
And I think if we use this description and say it over the phone to somebody or for some reason someone

145
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:13,410
is closing their eyes they can get a pretty good picture of what we're talking about if we use this

146
00:09:13,410 --> 00:09:16,500
description they can get a good image in their mind.

147
00:09:16,590 --> 00:09:18,230
What does this graph look like.

148
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:25,140
Next we're going to talk a little bit about how we might analyze this graph how we might break it down

149
00:09:25,350 --> 00:09:28,290
break it down can say break.

150
00:09:28,290 --> 00:09:34,980
Break it down remember analyze means to talk about maybe what it means even though it might be a guess.

151
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:37,290
So let's let's see what that could look like.

152
00:09:37,290 --> 00:09:37,950
Just for fun.
