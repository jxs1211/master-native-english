- We'll talk a bit about how to ask for the check which is very simple and then we'll have a practice
- So let's get started.
- So whether you're in a restaurant or not there are some common ways to ask for things and we've looked at a couple of these phrases before.
- So some of this will be review.
- But we do want to talk about a couple of key phrases especially for being in a restaurant.
- these are the most common phrases for asking what you want
- Could I please have a ...
- Can I get a chicken
- I think I'll order a chocolate cake for dessert
- remember we do things in context
- These are the basics but we are going to go into how they're used in context remember we do things in
  context and the reason that we do everything in context in this situation with real examples is because just knowing one sentence makes it hard to actually then use because you're not sure if that one sentence exactly fits right.
- So we'll go through a real situation ordering in a restaurant and leading up to ordering.
- Now this person the host or hostess is the person who greets you at the door takes you to your table
- or maybe checks your reservation, a reservation means that you have called beforehand to actually get a table.
- They're writing all that down.
- But the person on the phone will probably miss some details if you say I'd like to book or reserve a table for six under Jones at seven thirty.
- Yep that's correct.
- Do you have a reservation.
- There is a ten minute wait. Is that OK. Yeah that's all right.
- Well let's just start the situation fresh and make it simpler by saying we just have two people
- We've done the reservation thing so let's just say we walk into the restaurant there's a hostess and she just says how many.
- Now I want to make a specific request I say Do you have any seats or tables by the window.
- could we have/look at some menus please.
- this is a very common way to say it.
- I can say just water instead of I'd like to have a glass of water here because I'm directly responding to the question
- Can I get you something to drink.
- So this is a common way to respond to this sort of question.
- Just water for now.
- Could we look at the the wine list.
- alcohol is maybe red wine white wine beer maybe whiskey maybe vodka or a cocktail perhaps, All of these things are called alcohol.
- If you ever hear the phrase on the house on the house that means that you don't need to pay it's free.
  For example if your food is an hour late and you waited and you're starving they say Oh I'm so sorry for you know waiting. Everything is on the house.
- So if you see House red house white basically what that means is this is our basic wine.
  This is the wine that we recommend.
  It's usually not super expensive maybe not the cheapest but close to the bottom.
- And then she'll usually are you ready to order. Have you decided what you'd like. Sometimes she'll say have you decided.
- And then if you haven't decided what should you say you're still thinking right you're still thinking. could you please give us another minute. We need a minute. Not quite.
- That's OK if you put both of those together.
