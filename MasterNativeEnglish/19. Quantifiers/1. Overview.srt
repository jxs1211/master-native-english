1
00:00:04,050 --> 00:00:10,800
In the last lesson we talked about everyday tasks things we need to do on a regular basis and how we

2
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:12,950
can describe those things clearly.

3
00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:18,900
In this lesson we're going to talk about quanta fires basically a quanta Fire is an expression and you

4
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:25,200
know many of them which can give us a feeling for how many or how much of something we have without

5
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:26,640
using the specific number.

6
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:36,300
So we don't say one two three but basically do we have a large amount of something a small amount of

7
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:36,930
something.

8
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:37,800
What.

9
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:45,900
So we are looking at quantity and if I say a few oranges a few oranges you probably have a picture in

10
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:47,880
your mind for what that means.

11
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:52,420
Maybe you're picturing three or maybe four oranges on a table.

12
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:58,650
So that's a really good way to be able to communicate that the size or the amount of something clearly

13
00:00:58,680 --> 00:00:59,910
or fairly clearly.

14
00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:03,170
But there's a lot of confusion around quanta fires.

15
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:09,060
I know that you probably know most of them but we've got to make sure we use them correctly so that

16
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:13,080
we don't give the wrong impression so that we don't miss communicate.

17
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:20,430
So in this lesson we're going to first make sure we're very clear on countable vs. uncountable nouns.

18
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:27,120
We need to be very clear about that and then we'll get into some actual quanta fires and we'll go through

19
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:31,780
a lot of examples so that and I'm sure you know most of them already.

20
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:38,010
So that you're clear on exactly when they should be used and when they should not be used.

21
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:38,820
Let's get started.
