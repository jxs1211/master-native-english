1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,190
Now I think enough and a lot are very interesting.

2
00:00:03,210 --> 00:00:05,860
We could say a lot or lots.

3
00:00:06,030 --> 00:00:07,280
Pretty much the same thing.

4
00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:15,850
Lots lots of very interesting because they can be used both with countable and uncountable nouns.

5
00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:20,850
So if you're ever wondering well I want to say a huge amount but I don't know which word to use you

6
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:21,910
should use a lot.

7
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:26,480
You should use lots if you want to say well this is the right amount.

8
00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:27,590
You should say enough.

9
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:31,440
And it doesn't usually matter if it's countable or uncountable.

10
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:32,880
They can be used with both.

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,950
Let's look at some examples.

12
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:35,250
OK.

13
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:38,370
Beer is beer countable or uncountable.

14
00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:40,310
Well sometimes it's countable.

15
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:43,140
Usually beer is uncountable.

16
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:43,650
OK.

17
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:45,680
It's uncountable you know.

18
00:00:45,770 --> 00:00:46,250
OK.

19
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:53,280
And so if I say there's there's enough beer for everyone.

20
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:54,210
Help yourself.

21
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:55,980
It's enough beer for everyone.

22
00:00:55,980 --> 00:00:58,750
Help yourself take as much as you want.

23
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:02,930
So enough means that it satisfies the need.

24
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:08,010
There's a need here and whatever amount this is satisfies that need.

25
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:11,100
It's the right amount for that need.

26
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:11,520
OK.

27
00:01:11,550 --> 00:01:15,870
So there's enough beer this is for an uncountable noun beer.

28
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:22,350
And we can do the same thing if we're talking about food like cat food which is also uncountable but

29
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:30,990
we can use not not enough if we want to say that the requirement is this much and there is too little

30
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:31,940
for that.

31
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:33,090
We've we've learned little.

32
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:33,390
Right.

33
00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:34,680
So there's too little.

34
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:35,640
There should be more.

35
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:39,210
So if if there isn't.

36
00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:43,110
Which means is not enough cat food.

37
00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:45,540
Go buy more.

38
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:48,230
If there isn't enough cat food go buy more.

39
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:48,700
OK.

40
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:54,200
This is a very very common way to express that we need to get something.

41
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:55,170
We need to get something.

42
00:01:55,170 --> 00:01:56,190
There isn't enough.

43
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:57,590
You didn't get enough.

44
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,070
Please go buy more.

45
00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:01,020
You didn't get enough cat food.

46
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:02,790
Can you please buy some more.

47
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:10,380
Or if we wanted to say something countable we could say you didn't buy enough cups you didn't buy enough

48
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:15,090
cups countable please go buy more please go buy more.

49
00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:15,380
All right.

50
00:02:15,390 --> 00:02:17,520
So again countable or uncountable.

51
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,110
They work for both.

52
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:22,500
Do you know Sesame Street that TV show for kids.

53
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:24,090
There's a blue monster on there.

54
00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:25,800
His name is Cookie Monster.

55
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:26,870
He loves cookies.

56
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:29,590
I love Cookie Monster cookies are accountable.

57
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:42,300
OK so Cookie Monster on num num num num cookie monster gets very angry if he doesn't get enough cookies

58
00:02:42,570 --> 00:02:48,270
if you watch Cookie Monster on Sesame Street you will see he gets very unhappy if he does not get enough

59
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:48,920
cookies.

60
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:49,590
Very angry.

61
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:50,140
OK.

62
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:50,670
A lot.

63
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:55,320
Lots also for countable and uncountable very very useful.

64
00:02:55,320 --> 00:03:01,510
And it's basically similar to many but many is for countable things.

65
00:03:01,530 --> 00:03:05,870
So it's a large amount of something a large amount of something.

66
00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:12,800
It's the opposite of saying for example little it's the opposite of saying Phew.

67
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:14,670
Phew is a small amount.

68
00:03:14,670 --> 00:03:16,710
Little is a small amount.

69
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:17,270
OK.

70
00:03:17,290 --> 00:03:18,210
It's the opposite.

71
00:03:18,210 --> 00:03:18,750
Here we go.

72
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:24,400
I've got I've got lots of good ideas.

73
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:27,750
I've got lots of good ideas ideas countable or uncountable.

74
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:32,660
It is countable one idea two ideas three ideas countable countable.

75
00:03:32,710 --> 00:03:39,090
There's a lot more snow coming tomorrow.

76
00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:41,570
So a lot more snow coming tomorrow.

77
00:03:41,670 --> 00:03:47,100
OK snow countable or uncountable uncountable cannot count snow.

78
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:57,300
You can say snow flake teeny teeny tiny little thing a snow flake AFL AK e but usually snow is uncountable.

79
00:03:57,300 --> 00:03:59,680
Let's look at a couple more examples of this one.

80
00:03:59,730 --> 00:04:03,430
Oh by the way can we say there's lots more snow.

81
00:04:03,450 --> 00:04:04,440
Is that the same.

82
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:05,640
Yes it's the same.

83
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:06,620
It's exactly the same.

84
00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:09,750
There's a lot more there's lots more.

85
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:10,700
Those are the same.

86
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:17,160
You're you're asking a lot of questions today.

87
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:19,410
You're asking a lot of questions today.

88
00:04:19,410 --> 00:04:20,500
That's great.

89
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,140
That's great.

90
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:22,410
OK.

91
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:24,300
One more example one more example.

92
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:30,690
A lot of people don't like classical music people countable or uncountable here countable.

93
00:04:30,690 --> 00:04:38,370
One person two people three people countable a lot of people don't like classical music for some reason

94
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:39,110
I like it.

95
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:50,110
I used to remember lots of my dreams but now I don't.

96
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:50,480
OK.

97
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:55,690
Dreams countable or uncountable countable wondering to dreams countable.

98
00:04:55,690 --> 00:05:03,220
OK so these two both really useful to express things that are both countable and uncountable.

99
00:05:03,230 --> 00:05:03,540
OK.

100
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:04,270
Very useful.
