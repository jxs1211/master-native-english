1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:00,400
All right.

2
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:07,070
Let's go on and talk about a bit and much but actually we generally don't use much by itself.

3
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:13,220
We can say how much but when we're making a statement we always put it with something else like not

4
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:14,790
or 2 or so.

5
00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:18,040
And we'll look at some examples of how we can do that.

6
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:22,050
So a bit now as we did with the last one a little.

7
00:00:22,110 --> 00:00:25,440
It's often used to make things understated again.

8
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:28,220
This one is for uncountable nouns.

9
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:29,300
It's why I wrote this here.

10
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:36,420
So people might use it to say as we did last time I'm a bit tired I'm a bit tired maybe I should I should

11
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:37,030
go home.

12
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:39,330
But let's look at a couple more examples.

13
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:51,240
You've got a bit you've got a bit of sauce on your face though you're eating something and nobody wants

14
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:53,280
to have sauce on their face.

15
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:54,550
That's not good right.

16
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:58,450
But you have a little we could say a little you have a little right there.

17
00:00:58,470 --> 00:01:03,100
You didn't notice it and maybe other people saw it but they are too afraid to mention it.

18
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:08,280
So I'm not afraid to mention it because you probably want someone to mention it so that you can wipe

19
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:09,570
it off right.

20
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:10,980
Wipe it off.

21
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:13,430
You've got some sauce on your face here.

22
00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:15,700
You've got a bit of sauce on your face here.

23
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:18,180
You've got a little sauce on your face here.

24
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:18,670
OK.

25
00:01:18,690 --> 00:01:21,050
Very common in this sort of situation.

26
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:27,810
There's a bit of an issue with the server.

27
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:34,380
So a server is where data is stored and maybe one company has one.

28
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:39,080
It's having some problems instead of saying there's a major issue with the server.

29
00:01:39,130 --> 00:01:41,120
There's a huge problem with the server.

30
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:47,150
Someone who might like to be a little bit understated might say there's a bit of an issue with the server.

31
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:54,870
Now that can mean because a bit does mean a small amount just like a little does could mean that the

32
00:01:54,870 --> 00:01:59,760
issue is very small but it could also mean that the issue is not small.

33
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:01,980
It could mean that the issue is very big.

34
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:04,250
But we're being understated.

35
00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:09,270
We're trying to downplay it a bit and not make it so maybe frantic.

36
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:12,180
We're not trying to make it sound too too serious.

37
00:02:12,190 --> 00:02:15,020
There's a bit of an issue with the server.

38
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:21,720
Now we often use a bit when we want to give feedback to somebody if you tell somebody something about

39
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:23,820
themselves that's not good.

40
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:28,690
That's negative directly and you say you made a mistake.

41
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:29,910
How will they feel.

42
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:30,960
They'll feel bad.

43
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:32,400
They won't feel good about that.

44
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:39,270
So if we say instead I think I think you're being a bit too critical with the students if I say you're

45
00:02:39,270 --> 00:02:45,270
being too critical with the students critical means that maybe you're criticizing them too much saying

46
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:46,770
they're wrong too often.

47
00:02:46,770 --> 00:02:53,730
If we say a bit too critical we really make it softer we really make it sound not friendly it's still

48
00:02:53,730 --> 00:02:59,950
direct but it's a lot more polite and it feels like it's a little bit more gentle.

49
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,440
And so the person who hears it will probably be more accepting of it.

50
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:08,630
So we often use a little and a bit when we're giving feedback.

51
00:03:08,670 --> 00:03:15,450
And I like to call it a softener not the softener that you put in your laundry with your laundry detergent

52
00:03:15,690 --> 00:03:20,500
but a softener with language to make things sound a little less direct.

53
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:21,630
We can use.

54
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:22,620
We can use a bit.

55
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:24,190
We can also use a little.

56
00:03:24,450 --> 00:03:26,830
OK so let's go on and talk about much.

57
00:03:26,850 --> 00:03:28,110
So is this OK.

58
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:30,930
How much money do you have much.

59
00:03:30,930 --> 00:03:31,620
No it's not.

60
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:32,580
It's incorrect.

61
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:37,660
Much doesn't go by itself it goes with other words such as not.

62
00:03:37,710 --> 00:03:42,760
We can also often say so much too much.

63
00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:46,750
And if it's a question how much much more.

64
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:51,050
OK there's are some ways that we can use much with other words.

65
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:51,360
All right.

66
00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:57,750
So let's look at some specific specific examples by the way this is uncountable just like the other

67
00:03:57,750 --> 00:03:59,130
one generally.

68
00:03:59,190 --> 00:03:59,630
OK.

69
00:03:59,970 --> 00:04:04,350
So how much are these question answer.

70
00:04:04,350 --> 00:04:05,160
Not much.

71
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:09,870
That's not a good answer because it's not specific because not much for you may be different than not

72
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:11,170
much for me.

73
00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:12,270
We should give me a number.

74
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:15,240
But anyway that is grammatically correct.

75
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:24,000
I don't have much money left after my trip.

76
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,120
I don't have much money left after my trip.

77
00:04:26,130 --> 00:04:27,650
Don't have much.

78
00:04:27,650 --> 00:04:30,840
OK do not have much.

79
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:31,840
This is not.

80
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:33,580
This is the same as not much.

81
00:04:33,650 --> 00:04:35,130
It's the same basic grammar.

82
00:04:35,190 --> 00:04:38,250
But instead we say do not have much.

83
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:41,830
This is a whole piece that we put together which is very common.

84
00:04:41,850 --> 00:04:48,900
Too much is also a very common phrase when we are using much so I think this is this whole sentence

85
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:49,980
is very common.

86
00:04:49,980 --> 00:05:03,250
I think I think you've I think you've got way too much time on your hands.

87
00:05:03,310 --> 00:05:09,300
So somebody is doing something that maybe I feel is a waste of time and you're not being very productive.

88
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:14,630
And I think you're only doing something because you're lazy and you don't have anything else to do.

89
00:05:14,650 --> 00:05:18,340
So I could say I think you've got way too much time on your hands.

90
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:19,860
I mean it's you should be busier.

91
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:22,030
So that's usually a criticism.

92
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:30,010
It's usually a bit critical but this way too much is a very common way to phrase something and time

93
00:05:30,010 --> 00:05:32,530
on your hands way too much time on your hands.

94
00:05:32,530 --> 00:05:35,990
This whole piece is a very common expression very common.

95
00:05:36,010 --> 00:05:38,600
So let's try so much if we can.

96
00:05:38,710 --> 00:05:50,760
There's there's so much so much work to do before the party the party on Friday.

97
00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:52,110
So many things to do.

98
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:59,440
Many things to do or so much to do so much to do before the party on Friday.

99
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:00,380
Very common.

100
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:05,620
Pay so much not much and too much are extremely extremely common.

101
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:16,830
Just one more example very quickly I've got I've got much more experience than you.

102
00:06:16,870 --> 00:06:19,450
I've got much more experience than you.

103
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:22,000
This one's also quite common.

104
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,830
Much more much more.

105
00:06:23,830 --> 00:06:24,810
I have much more.

106
00:06:24,810 --> 00:06:26,660
I've got much more.

107
00:06:27,050 --> 00:06:27,330
OK.
