1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:05,010
Finally we're going to talk about any none and no very very common.

2
00:00:05,010 --> 00:00:09,560
And the best way to really learn these is by example to get a feeling for them.

3
00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:15,720
Any can be used for questions and it can also be used as an answer to the same question.

4
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:18,920
The most common question is do you have any.

5
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:21,590
Plus the thing you could just say Do you have any.

6
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:23,130
I need some chocolate.

7
00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:24,360
Do you have any.

8
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:25,920
I don't have any.

9
00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:27,970
We don't say I have any.

10
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:29,710
We would say I have some.

11
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:32,580
So we would use any if it's an answer.

12
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:35,060
Only if it's when it's zero.

13
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:36,450
The amount is zero.

14
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:37,700
We have none.

15
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:39,950
We don't say I have any.

16
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:44,590
We never say that but when we ask the question we can say Do you have any.

17
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:46,020
Do you have any.

18
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:47,850
Do you have any chocolate.

19
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:49,260
I don't have any.

20
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:50,370
This is how it's used.

21
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:54,000
None is usually at the end of the sentence.

22
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,070
She gave me none.

23
00:00:56,190 --> 00:00:57,780
I got none.

24
00:00:57,780 --> 00:00:59,640
There was none.

25
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:04,330
Usually it goes at the end of the sentence and it means it means zero means zero.

26
00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:10,560
No then is usually followed by something else unless it's a statement to answer a question a yes no

27
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:11,270
question.

28
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:12,170
Do you want to go.

29
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:12,630
No.

30
00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:13,110
No.

31
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:19,860
But if we're talking about an amount of something this classes about quantifies the amount to zero then

32
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:21,330
we would say no.

33
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:25,030
Plus the thing for example we have no time.

34
00:01:25,050 --> 00:01:26,130
We have no time.

35
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:30,900
We have very little time means we have some but almost no time.

36
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:33,180
If it's zero we can say no time.

37
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:33,830
We have no time.

38
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:34,410
We need to go.

39
00:01:34,410 --> 00:01:35,590
We have no time.

40
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:39,530
So let's look at some examples and you can get a better feeling for this.

41
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:41,300
I don't want any help.

42
00:01:41,370 --> 00:01:42,710
Do you need any help.

43
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:44,480
Remember it can be used in a question.

44
00:01:44,550 --> 00:01:45,800
Do you need any help.

45
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:47,560
We wouldn't say I want any help.

46
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:51,150
We would say I really I really need some help.

47
00:01:51,150 --> 00:01:53,260
I really need your help but if it's no.

48
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,200
If it's 0 I don't.

49
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,290
I don't want any help.

50
00:01:56,310 --> 00:01:57,450
I don't need any help.

51
00:01:57,450 --> 00:02:01,260
Did you find any quarters quarters are twenty five cents.

52
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:03,990
Twenty five cents that we use in America.

53
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:05,670
Did you find any quarters.

54
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:06,480
No.

55
00:02:06,470 --> 00:02:09,910
None or I could say I didn't find any quarters.

56
00:02:09,930 --> 00:02:11,210
I didn't find any.

57
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:14,550
So as a question did you find any as an answer.

58
00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:18,230
No none noticed that none goes by itself.

59
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:23,510
And if I want to say I didn't find any.

60
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:26,360
That is also totally OK.

61
00:02:26,370 --> 00:02:27,330
All right.

62
00:02:27,330 --> 00:02:28,600
I asked for help.

63
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:32,250
I got none notice that none is at the end of the sentence.

64
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:33,990
There's nothing after it.

65
00:02:33,990 --> 00:02:37,570
We don't usually put anything after none.

66
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:40,070
We already stated the thing we're talking about.

67
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,850
We're talking about help.

68
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:42,300
OK.

69
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:43,860
I asked for help.

70
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:45,180
We know we're talking about help.

71
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:48,360
Then the next thing we say is I got none.

72
00:02:48,450 --> 00:02:50,510
I got no help.

73
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:52,290
I got no help.

74
00:02:52,290 --> 00:02:56,850
I could say I got no help.

75
00:02:56,850 --> 00:02:58,390
Or could we use any.

76
00:02:58,410 --> 00:02:58,950
Yes we could.

77
00:02:58,950 --> 00:03:01,800
We could say I didn't get any help.

78
00:03:01,830 --> 00:03:04,030
So all of those are OK.

79
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:05,330
They're the same thing.

80
00:03:05,370 --> 00:03:06,260
I got none.

81
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:07,560
I got no help.

82
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:09,510
I didn't get any help.

83
00:03:09,510 --> 00:03:10,200
Same thing.

84
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:12,160
I basically got no help.

85
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:14,060
Basically got no help.

86
00:03:14,070 --> 00:03:16,280
I have no time left.

87
00:03:16,350 --> 00:03:18,470
I have no time left.

88
00:03:18,690 --> 00:03:20,290
I have little time left.

89
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:22,000
I have no time left now.

90
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:25,580
Can that be used to understate something.

91
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:32,040
Sometimes if we're in a big hurry we might have a few minutes but we don't want to say we have a few

92
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:33,440
minutes a little time.

93
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:35,360
So we say I'm sorry I have no time.

94
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:36,220
I have no time.

95
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:41,220
OK we're emphasizing that we don't want to give any of our time.

96
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:42,920
Don't want to give any of our time.

97
00:03:42,990 --> 00:03:44,500
There are no more books.

98
00:03:44,550 --> 00:03:47,230
There are no more books.

99
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:48,660
So this is often used.

100
00:03:48,690 --> 00:03:49,810
No more is used.

101
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:52,870
Followed by the thing that we're talking about.

102
00:03:52,890 --> 00:03:53,820
I got no help.

103
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:55,220
We say help after No.

104
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:59,430
No more books books goes after no no time.

105
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:00,690
Time goes after No.

106
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:02,300
Did you get any help.

107
00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:03,090
None.

108
00:04:03,090 --> 00:04:04,200
Are there any books.

109
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:04,570
No.

110
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:05,130
None.

111
00:04:05,130 --> 00:04:06,160
Nothing after that.

112
00:04:06,210 --> 00:04:11,160
So these examples I hope make any none and no very very clear.

113
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:17,120
And make sure you practice these and look out for them as your reading or as you're speaking with others.

114
00:04:17,130 --> 00:04:22,290
Pay attention to when they're used because the more examples you see the better of an understanding

115
00:04:22,290 --> 00:04:27,840
you can get for these phrases and quanta fires although they're very simple are extremely important

116
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:33,990
and you need to feel super duper comfortable with them in order to use them naturally when you speak.

117
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:40,230
OK so if you didn't already you should have a very clear picture of how different quanta fires are used

118
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:44,070
to express different quantities different amounts.

119
00:04:44,070 --> 00:04:48,630
The best way to really get a natural feeling for them because you can know them but not really know

120
00:04:48,630 --> 00:04:54,180
how to use them when you're speaking the best way to naturally get a feeling for them to really use

121
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:58,020
them is to practice practice practice until they become habits.

122
00:04:58,020 --> 00:05:02,290
I can't express that enough one part of learning is knowledge.

123
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:04,710
One part of learning is habits.

124
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:08,640
Habits come through practice and repetition practice makes perfect.

125
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:13,500
So make two sentences for every quanta fire that we learned in this lesson.

126
00:05:13,530 --> 00:05:16,810
Try to make two clear sentences of different types.

127
00:05:16,810 --> 00:05:20,660
OK then if you want to read through them and record them that would be a good idea.

128
00:05:20,670 --> 00:05:24,420
You can listen to your pronunciation and see if you can make any corrections.

129
00:05:24,510 --> 00:05:29,430
And if you want to make more than two sentences more than two examples that is just fine.

130
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:31,450
The more practice the better.

131
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:32,010
Hey good luck.

132
00:05:32,010 --> 00:05:33,210
I'll see you in the next lesson.
