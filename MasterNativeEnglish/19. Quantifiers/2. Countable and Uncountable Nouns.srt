1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:02,360
First countable and uncountable nouns.

2
00:00:02,370 --> 00:00:04,430
Let's just be very clear on these.

3
00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:12,430
A noun can be a physical thing an object or something more abstract something we cannot touch.

4
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:19,910
It is in many cases the uncountable things that we cannot touch and the things we can touch are countable.

5
00:00:19,940 --> 00:00:25,580
But let's not say that's a rule because there are lots of examples in which that's not true.

6
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:27,120
And we'll just look at a couple.

7
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:28,800
So for example chairs.

8
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:35,790
Well we can say one chair two chairs three chairs OK one chair because there is one we say chair and

9
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:39,110
then because there's more than one we say chairs.

10
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:40,320
We had an.

11
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:41,430
This one.

12
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:51,750
One person two people we can count one two three cups one cup two cups ideas cookies eyes eyes.

13
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:53,810
Push one push Two pushes.

14
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:54,130
OK.

15
00:00:54,150 --> 00:00:57,290
Builders discoveries stories.

16
00:00:57,330 --> 00:00:59,040
A story two stories.

17
00:00:59,040 --> 00:00:59,490
Fish.

18
00:00:59,490 --> 00:01:01,800
One fish two fish.

19
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:03,390
Sometimes it doesn't change.

20
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:03,990
Children.

21
00:01:04,020 --> 00:01:04,850
One child.

22
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:06,000
Two children.

23
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,150
Eggs an egg.

24
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:08,980
Two eggs grains.

25
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:10,620
One grain two grains.

26
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:12,530
Very very small boats.

27
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:13,530
Boats.

28
00:01:13,660 --> 00:01:14,110
A boat.

29
00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:14,870
Two boats.

30
00:01:14,910 --> 00:01:17,500
But I should be very very clear.

31
00:01:17,550 --> 00:01:22,440
Sometimes things that are often countable can be uncountable.

32
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:24,600
That means you cannot count them for example.

33
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:29,780
Discovery can be a more general idea when something is a more general idea.

34
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:33,870
It's often uncountable so we can have a discovery to discoveries.

35
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:35,530
But we can just say for example.

36
00:01:35,550 --> 00:01:39,660
Discovery is the very beginning of a new trend.

37
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:44,290
Discovery is the beginning of a new trend that is not accountable discovery.

38
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:46,910
That is an uncountable discovery.

39
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:48,480
That's a general idea.

40
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:55,110
OK now I want to just mention one thing very quickly when we're talking about something generally speaking

41
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:57,330
and it's a countable thing.

42
00:01:57,390 --> 00:01:59,310
Let's use the plural form.

43
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:04,380
Let's use the plural form the reason we use the plural form is because we could be talking about any

44
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:05,810
one of those things.

45
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:10,320
For example you should say I like dogs not I like dog.

46
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:11,490
Children are wonderful.

47
00:02:11,490 --> 00:02:12,600
Children are wonderful.

48
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:14,340
We're using the plural form.

49
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:16,460
Not one child but children.

50
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:17,260
Children.

51
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:19,230
So we just have to be careful about that.

52
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:21,600
And again it can be a little bit more complicated.

53
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:24,660
For example we would say I like pizza.

54
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:25,610
I like pizza.

55
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:31,890
But then if we say pizza in that way we're actually saying an uncountable thing an uncountable thing.

56
00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:37,380
So sometimes nouns that we can count one pizza two pizzas also become uncountable.

57
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:44,580
If we're talking about a general idea that thing for example pizza we often use that for different kinds

58
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:45,440
of food.

59
00:02:45,450 --> 00:02:49,300
OK so uncountable things are things we generally cannot count.

60
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:51,900
And again there are examples when it can be both.

61
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:58,990
For example you could say one time two times one time I went to Canada the second time I went to Germany.

62
00:02:59,130 --> 00:03:02,310
But the idea of time is uncountable hope.

63
00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:03,590
Can you say one hope.

64
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:06,320
Oh I suppose but it's Yeah.

65
00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:09,810
Generally uncountable ambition ambition.

66
00:03:10,050 --> 00:03:10,830
Milk.

67
00:03:10,830 --> 00:03:12,180
You can't count a liquid.

68
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:13,980
OK liquids are another one.

69
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:17,790
Experience experience very similar to discovery.

70
00:03:17,790 --> 00:03:23,460
If we make this discovery we can say many experiences but we're then talking about each one.

71
00:03:23,490 --> 00:03:30,210
But if we're talking about the general idea of experience then we can't make it a plural we can't count

72
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:31,300
it.

73
00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:35,300
Orange juice is another liquid teamwork Love.

74
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:37,070
Love is an idea.

75
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:43,720
Generally not countable sadness and emotion generally not countable Joy beauty.

76
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:49,400
So we're talking about a lot of a lot of concepts a lot of concepts over here general ideas.

77
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:55,050
So when we have these general ideas we're putting them in the uncountable form we're considering them

78
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:57,940
uncountable and just to be very very clear.

79
00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:04,470
You can often make these countable as well because you could say I'd like to have an orange juice.

80
00:04:04,530 --> 00:04:11,490
If we're talking about a specific one that's ok it's ok but most often if we say I like orange juice

81
00:04:11,670 --> 00:04:16,770
we're using the uncountable version or form of orange juice.

82
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:19,960
OK if we say experience is very important.

83
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:23,480
We're not talking about specific experiences that we can count.

84
00:04:23,490 --> 00:04:31,560
We're talking about the idea the concept of experience in which case we should use the uncountable form

85
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:32,570
uncountable.

86
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:33,060
All right.

87
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:33,840
I hope that's clear.

88
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:39,640
I wanted to just make that very very clear before we get started with examples of each different quantifying.
