1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:00,530
All right.

2
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:07,410
We're getting close to the end of our lesson on quanta fires and we're going to look at now three which

3
00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:10,320
are used only for countable nouns.

4
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:12,210
A couple a few and several.

5
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:13,740
And actually they're very similar.

6
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:16,920
Let's just talk very quickly about the differences between them.

7
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:22,210
A couple is generally too although sometimes people use it to say three.

8
00:00:22,290 --> 00:00:25,860
It's just something that kind of becomes a habit for some people.

9
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:29,070
A few is more than two but not many.

10
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:30,980
It's usually a small number of.

11
00:00:31,110 --> 00:00:35,500
And some people again might use it for two out of habit.

12
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:39,240
But generally speaking it just means not many.

13
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:44,580
And then several is more than two but not many more than two but not many.

14
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:51,060
And again sometimes sometimes you might hear people use it for two but definitely not one definitely

15
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:51,900
not one.

16
00:00:51,900 --> 00:01:01,500
And this can be very you know a wide range because a few could be a hundred at the small end of a very

17
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:07,270
large scale if the scale is on this and 10 billion.

18
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:09,910
And on this end a hundred.

19
00:01:10,050 --> 00:01:12,690
Well some people might say then a hundred is a few.

20
00:01:12,690 --> 00:01:18,960
So there are some there are some good interesting examples where a few is actually a lot compared to

21
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:19,540
one.

22
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:22,160
Generally that's not the case.

23
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:26,400
Generally it's three four five maybe six.

24
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:27,890
That's how it's usually used.

25
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:34,660
But I just want to show you that it is possible in some cases to use it as a much larger number.

26
00:01:34,790 --> 00:01:42,170
Several several OK several is usually three four sometimes five.

27
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:43,400
Usually around there.

28
00:01:43,410 --> 00:01:45,820
But it's it's not too it's not too.

29
00:01:45,870 --> 00:01:51,500
Let's actually go through some examples of these simple words and phrases.

30
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:57,990
It takes a couple weeks to process applications to an application is something that you need to maybe

31
00:01:57,990 --> 00:02:03,810
fill in if you're going to get a bank account or maybe apply for a job or a visa.

32
00:02:03,810 --> 00:02:10,210
And it has steps a process has steps but process here is a verb to process something.

33
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:13,110
So it takes several weeks to process.

34
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:17,500
That means they need to review it and check it before they give you a result.

35
00:02:17,690 --> 00:02:19,200
It takes a couple weeks.

36
00:02:19,230 --> 00:02:22,620
Means it takes probably two weeks or around there.

37
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:27,360
It doesn't mean exactly 14 days maybe 13 maybe 15.

38
00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:31,050
If you want to put in usually here you could.

39
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:34,740
It usually takes a couple weeks to process applications.

40
00:02:34,770 --> 00:02:35,180
OK.

41
00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:40,410
I need a few minutes to calm down a few minutes to calm down.

42
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:42,030
Something crazy happens.

43
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:46,620
I've stressed I've been fired or whatever and someone says Hey are you OK.

44
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:53,730
And I go Oh yeah give me a few minutes to calm down so calming down is what we do after something exciting

45
00:02:53,730 --> 00:02:56,890
happens that makes us feel stressed.

46
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,800
We feel stressed we need to calm down.

47
00:02:59,010 --> 00:03:02,240
And it might take us three four five six minutes to do that.

48
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:04,110
Take a few aspirin.

49
00:03:04,110 --> 00:03:05,810
Take a few aspirin.

50
00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:06,320
OK.

51
00:03:06,330 --> 00:03:12,330
Aspirin is something that we take for pain relief when to relieve pain and we would take two or three

52
00:03:12,570 --> 00:03:15,990
or four of those depending on maybe our age.

53
00:03:15,990 --> 00:03:17,810
I'm not giving you medical advice here.

54
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:18,620
Check the bottle.

55
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:20,220
OK.

56
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:30,000
After several reminders he was fired several three maybe four OK maybe five reminders are basically

57
00:03:30,090 --> 00:03:37,080
times when he did something bad he was late on Monday and then he was late the next month on Thursday

58
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:43,590
and the next month it was late on Wednesday and he was given two reminders and then given a final reminder

59
00:03:43,770 --> 00:03:48,120
and then he was fired don't be late Don't be late Don't be late you're fired.

60
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:53,840
Those three are reminders and several is to give you a feeling for the number.

61
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:57,400
Why don't we just say the number why don't we say he was given three reminders.

62
00:03:57,450 --> 00:03:58,900
Well take three aspirin.

63
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:05,310
We could we could but I feel it makes the world very stiff when we give specific numbers and in life

64
00:04:05,490 --> 00:04:07,860
we don't always know exact numbers.

65
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:08,220
Right.

66
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:14,690
We often want to give a general idea and we have no idea what the specific number is.

67
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:17,220
So that's why quantum fires are so useful.

68
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:25,860
That's why quantum fires help us to express quantities or amounts and not be locked into being wrong

69
00:04:25,950 --> 00:04:27,880
because we gave the wrong number.

70
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:28,170
Right.

71
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:32,730
So it's actually extremely useful and you need to know how to use them very naturally.
