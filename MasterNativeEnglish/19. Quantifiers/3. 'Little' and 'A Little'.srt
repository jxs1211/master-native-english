1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:03,300
All right so let's get started with some quanta fires.

2
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:11,130
I'm going to use count and non non for uncountable to mark these just so you know which ones they should

3
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:12,000
be connected to.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,460
Which nouns they should be connected to.

5
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:19,290
So a little and little are these countable or uncountable.

6
00:00:19,290 --> 00:00:20,970
Actually none.

7
00:00:20,990 --> 00:00:21,260
OK.

8
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:24,120
So these are both uncountable not none.

9
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:25,520
It's a different thing.

10
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:28,250
Non non uncountable.

11
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:35,010
So we wouldn't say for example a little cups we wouldn't say little cups although that does have a different

12
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:35,340
meaning.

13
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:37,720
If we're talking about little in this sense.

14
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:43,170
But if we use little in this sense then it's not a quanta fire it's an adjective.

15
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:50,410
OK so let's let's get started a little is positive and little is often negative.

16
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:56,020
That means when it's good news that we have a little of something right.

17
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:58,690
It's good news it's good not zero.

18
00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:05,580
Then we use a little if it's bad news we should have many maybe or I guess I should say a lot of something

19
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:09,000
and we don't we use little little.

20
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:14,250
So we usually focus on the negative for this one and the positive for this one for example let's do

21
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:16,520
a couple examples of each.

22
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:16,870
OK.

23
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:23,910
There's a there's a little coffee left if you want some.

24
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:24,930
It's not gone.

25
00:01:24,980 --> 00:01:25,750
That's great.

26
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:27,380
That means I can have some good.

27
00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:28,880
There's a little coffee left.

28
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:30,650
It's a positive statement OK.

29
00:01:30,740 --> 00:01:32,100
I've got a little time.

30
00:01:32,150 --> 00:01:32,720
What's up.

31
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:34,040
Someone asks for your time.

32
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:36,680
Hey do you think you could help me with something.

33
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:38,330
Yeah I've got a little time.

34
00:01:38,330 --> 00:01:38,960
What's up.

35
00:01:39,130 --> 00:01:40,520
What means how can I help you.

36
00:01:40,550 --> 00:01:46,460
So this is a positive statement means I have some time to give you now a lot is often used for things

37
00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:53,210
that are a little larger than we say and that's usually a good thing but we don't want to express it

38
00:01:53,230 --> 00:01:56,700
to confidently we want to be a little bit understated.

39
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:59,480
This is quite common in British English in particular.

40
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:05,960
So for example let's say you post a video and you suddenly become a famous Internet celebrity and someone

41
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:08,780
asks you about how things are going for you right.

42
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:16,880
You could say well it's it's a little little hectic right now a little hectic right now hectic means

43
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:21,230
very busy so you're probably very busy or probably totally swamped.

44
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:26,900
And you're wanting to express it in an understated way so you use a little very common to use a little

45
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:30,530
and also a bit which we'll talk about in a bit.

46
00:02:30,530 --> 00:02:31,290
Very soon.

47
00:02:31,290 --> 00:02:40,100
OK so I'm a little a little tired maybe I'm exhausted maybe I'm very tired and I want to go home but

48
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:43,820
you don't say to the host of the party I'm exhausted.

49
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:44,780
I want to go home.

50
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:46,330
You say I'm a little tired.

51
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:47,230
I think I'll go home.

52
00:02:47,230 --> 00:02:51,090
No I should probably go instead of saying I'm exhausted.

53
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:51,520
All right.

54
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:52,190
How about Little.

55
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:54,670
Well we focus more on the negative.

56
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:59,010
The fact that we're almost close to zero and that's not a good thing.

57
00:02:59,030 --> 00:03:05,710
For example there's too little time to finish the project.

58
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:06,590
It's terrible.

59
00:03:06,590 --> 00:03:11,060
That means we don't have enough it's not enough Not enough time.

60
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:12,220
This is bad.

61
00:03:12,350 --> 00:03:14,480
This is bad there's too little time.

62
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:16,250
We don't have enough time.

63
00:03:16,310 --> 00:03:17,790
We won't finish low.

64
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:19,340
That's not good.

65
00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:21,110
That's not good at all.

66
00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:21,920
We don't want that.

67
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:22,620
OK.

68
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:23,740
Let's try another one.

69
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:31,890
You have very little to do with the investigation.

70
00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:32,660
You can go.

71
00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:33,020
OK.

72
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:39,320
So there's an investigation maybe someone's in trouble maybe you're a witness you saw something happen

73
00:03:39,530 --> 00:03:45,110
and you're at the police station and they were asking you some questions but really you were far away

74
00:03:45,110 --> 00:03:47,110
you weren't really involved.

75
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:49,510
Maybe this is something we'd see on a TV show.

76
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:50,800
You weren't really involved.

77
00:03:50,810 --> 00:03:52,870
You just saw something happening.

78
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:59,150
And finally it's late and they say well you had very little to do with the investigation which means

79
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:00,730
almost nothing.

80
00:04:00,770 --> 00:04:03,660
And we're focusing on the fact that it's almost nothing.

81
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:06,070
OK you can go you can go.

82
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:09,260
So we're getting closer and closer to zero.

83
00:04:09,350 --> 00:04:12,330
And that's not to say it's a bad thing.

84
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:18,980
But the emphasis is on the fact that it's close to zero as opposed to a little which is focusing on

85
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:21,430
the fact that it's not zero.

86
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:22,400
I hope that makes sense.

87
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:23,780
I hope that difference is clear.

88
00:04:23,790 --> 00:04:24,150
OK.

89
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:28,630
There's so little food again.

90
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:30,010
We have almost no food.

91
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:31,160
There's so little food.

92
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:35,900
But if we say I have a little food that means probably you asked me for some.

93
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:37,360
And I'm willing to give you some.

94
00:04:37,370 --> 00:04:38,150
Here you are.

95
00:04:38,150 --> 00:04:40,400
So it's usually a little more positive.

96
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:41,570
Let's move on.
