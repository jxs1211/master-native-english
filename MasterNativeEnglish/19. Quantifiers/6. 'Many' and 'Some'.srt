1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:00,510
All right.

2
00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:06,540
So we've talked about quite a few quantifiable so far we've got still some more to go.

3
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:08,340
These are all really really common.

4
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:13,530
I want to be clear that there are others we're not talking about every single one that's out there.

5
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:16,710
We're talking about the ones that are very common and how to use them.

6
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:22,860
Now let's go on to many and some and I realize that you probably know pretty much all of these but it's

7
00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:25,620
got to be really really clear when you should use them.

8
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:32,060
So I just want to make sure we have this very important important lesson to brush up on the basics.

9
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:39,440
So many many as you probably know is for things that are countable like people like dreams like cups.

10
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:41,710
And some can be used for both.

11
00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:49,100
Very similar to a lot I would say that a lot and some are exact opposites.

12
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:54,960
A general rule you can follow is if you want to say a large amount and you're not sure which word to

13
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:59,560
use because you are thinking about is it countable or or uncountable.

14
00:00:59,580 --> 00:01:01,230
Well if it's a large amount use a lot.

15
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:03,280
If it's a small amount use some.

16
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:08,970
It's a great one because you don't have to think about which type of noun to use it with.

17
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:12,600
So let's look at some examples of many first.

18
00:01:12,860 --> 00:01:18,770
I've got many awards in my office.

19
00:01:18,770 --> 00:01:19,860
What kind of person is this.

20
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:20,760
Who says this.

21
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:23,070
I've got many awards in my office.

22
00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:26,090
Awards are things that you get if you do something well.

23
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:28,490
This person is talking about their awards.

24
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:35,730
I don't like this person bragging a little bit maybe showing off showing off a bit showing off anyway

25
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:38,960
they've got many awards could we say many time.

26
00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:43,920
No we cannot say many times if we're using time as accountable thing.

27
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:48,360
Like one time two times three times that I've been to Canada.

28
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:48,620
OK.

29
00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:52,920
But now we could not say many time the general idea time.

30
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:54,950
We could not say many hope.

31
00:01:55,010 --> 00:02:03,540
We could not say many milk for example say bottles of milk cups of milk grains of rice many grains of

32
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:04,010
rice.

33
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:06,280
But we cannot use any milk.

34
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:06,790
OK.

35
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:08,490
There are so many buttons.

36
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:10,540
There are so many buttons.

37
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:11,790
I'm confused.

38
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:12,570
OK.

39
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:15,600
Person is looking at a panel has a lot of buttons on it.

40
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:18,470
Which one do I push so many buttons.

41
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:19,540
We can count buttons.

42
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:20,670
So it works.

43
00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:23,190
So it works for the last two examples of many.

44
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:28,740
Let's look at some common idioms idioms are expressions that pretty much everybody knows.

45
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:30,920
And you have to say them as is OK.

46
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:36,810
Too many cooks in the kitchen spoil the broth and the broth is for example a soup.

47
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:41,520
And if you have a kitchen and there are many cooks working in that kitchen the idea is if there are

48
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:46,500
five or six of them all working on the same thing it's going to turn out bad.

49
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:52,530
Maybe they didn't communicate well one person puts in Salt another person comes in puts in more salt

50
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:54,180
but they didn't tell that person.

51
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:55,540
So now it's too salty.

52
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:57,870
So it's better if you have one person in control.

53
00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:04,050
Sometimes it's better to have fewer people because then whatever you're doing is more focused and there's

54
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:06,910
great communication there's a clear direction.

55
00:03:07,050 --> 00:03:10,020
Many people communicating too many cooks spoil the broth.

56
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:12,630
Means you're going to ruin whatever you're doing.

57
00:03:12,630 --> 00:03:14,300
If there are too many people involved.

58
00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:15,060
Very common.

59
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:17,900
There are many ways to skin a cat.

60
00:03:17,970 --> 00:03:20,040
That means to remove the skin of a cat.

61
00:03:20,050 --> 00:03:21,330
Now that's pretty gross.

62
00:03:21,330 --> 00:03:23,120
That's a pretty disgusting idea.

63
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:29,520
But it's a common expression which basically means our goal is to do this but there isn't only one way

64
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:30,640
to get there.

65
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:33,360
We're trying to get a million users.

66
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,300
We're trying to get a million users.

67
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:38,150
Well there are many different ways to get a million users.

68
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:45,270
We could spend a lot of money or maybe we make some very viral videos on the Internet and make a lot

69
00:03:45,270 --> 00:03:49,780
of people who see our videos come to look at whatever we're selling.

70
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:52,200
And so we can get a million users.

71
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:55,310
The idea is there isn't only one way to do something.

72
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:57,720
There are many ways to skin a cat.

73
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:04,950
Now for some as I mentioned it can be countable or uncountable and it's very similar to a bit in some

74
00:04:04,950 --> 00:04:09,960
ways because you can use it to be a little understated.

75
00:04:10,230 --> 00:04:22,680
So if you say I have I have some suggestions on how to how to improve or how you can improve right I

76
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:29,280
am improve improve how to improve well maybe I have many maybe I have quite a few things to say maybe

77
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:33,770
I'm going to talk for 20 minutes about how to help you improve.

78
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:38,970
My feedback will be very long but I say some as a way to make it a little understated.

79
00:04:38,970 --> 00:04:45,720
Now it's of course possible that it actually is some it actually is a small amount but I just want to

80
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:52,920
be clear some can be used in the same way as a little and a bit to be understated when actually it's

81
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:58,930
much much more even though the actual meaning of some is a small amount.

82
00:04:58,950 --> 00:05:02,060
OK you need some help with your makeup.

83
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:04,030
You need some help with your makeup.

84
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:11,390
OK so someone maybe has put makeup on maybe for a video and there's too much it's done incorrectly.

85
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:12,590
It looks weird.

86
00:05:12,610 --> 00:05:13,980
So one person makes a comment.

87
00:05:13,990 --> 00:05:17,860
You need some help is help countable or uncountable.

88
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:19,580
Help is uncountable.

89
00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:27,790
Help is uncountable it's a general concept so well for example suggestions is countable help is more

90
00:05:27,790 --> 00:05:33,150
of an idea more of an abstract thing uncountable but some can be used for both.

91
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:41,290
Now I'd like to give you two examples that get across this idea of how we can use a noun either as a

92
00:05:41,290 --> 00:05:43,900
countable thing or an uncountable thing.

93
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:47,620
Let's get some pizza let's get some pizzas.

94
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:49,000
What's different about these two.

95
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:56,220
Well you can see here that pizzas is now plural and it is countable because we could say a pizza.

96
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:59,260
Lets get off pizza or let's get some pizzas.

97
00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:04,450
That means more than one maybe three maybe four and let's get some pizza.

98
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:06,630
Now this is an uncountable.

99
00:06:06,670 --> 00:06:09,460
It's not single it's an uncountable noun.

100
00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:15,300
It's being used as a concept pizza can be uncountable as well.

101
00:06:15,310 --> 00:06:17,700
Now this sum also works.

102
00:06:17,830 --> 00:06:27,910
It still works if we say for example let's get a few a few pizzas then we can't say let's get a few

103
00:06:27,910 --> 00:06:28,900
pizza.

104
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:36,010
That doesn't work because a few can only be used for countable things but some works for both because

105
00:06:36,010 --> 00:06:37,270
some works for both.

106
00:06:37,510 --> 00:06:38,620
So it's pretty great.

107
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:42,370
We could say let's get let's get pizza.

108
00:06:42,370 --> 00:06:50,200
We can take this some out and then once again if we say let's get pizza it can still be uncountable.

109
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:52,390
We could say let's get a lot of pizza.

110
00:06:52,450 --> 00:06:53,780
It's uncountable.

111
00:06:53,890 --> 00:06:57,780
Last example give it some time.

112
00:06:57,850 --> 00:07:03,260
It will work out just fine.

113
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:04,590
Give it some time.

114
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:07,510
It will work out just fine.

115
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:09,790
Time countable or uncountable.

116
00:07:09,790 --> 00:07:10,920
It is uncountable.

117
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:14,730
In this case again it can be countable.

118
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:18,920
We could say I've been there a few times sometimes.

119
00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:21,610
Maybe we could say but here it's uncountable.

120
00:07:21,610 --> 00:07:24,920
It will all work out just fine that means don't worry about it.

121
00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:29,580
Just wait a little while and everything will be OK.

122
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:31,280
Everything will be OK all right.

123
00:07:31,330 --> 00:07:37,760
So some is in particular a very very useful quanta fire just like a lot.

124
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:38,700
Remember these two.

125
00:07:38,710 --> 00:07:41,260
If you don't remember anything else about this lesson.
