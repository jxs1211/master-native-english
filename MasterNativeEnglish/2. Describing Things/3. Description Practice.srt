1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:04,100
OK so now we have our poorly drawn cottage.

2
00:00:04,100 --> 00:00:05,370
You remember the word cottage.

3
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:07,530
This is our cottage.

4
00:00:07,650 --> 00:00:09,840
And hey the other word chimney.

5
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:10,950
There it is.

6
00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:12,680
There is the chimney needs a little smoke.

7
00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:16,320
I think obviously smoke.

8
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:18,110
Smoke makes that sound right.

9
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:19,660
That's really not good smoke.

10
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:22,380
I'm sorry about being such a bad artist.

11
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:23,610
I'm not an artist.

12
00:00:23,610 --> 00:00:24,480
I did my best.

13
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:28,830
I did draw this all by myself.

14
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:29,090
All right.

15
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:30,390
So we have a cottage.

16
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:34,470
It's got a chimney a cottage it's got a chimney.

17
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:39,150
And what's the material we need to first pick out our adjectives and our main noun.

18
00:00:39,190 --> 00:00:42,580
Well why don't we just use cottage as our main noun.

19
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:43,490
Make it simple.

20
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:44,000
OK.

21
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:52,150
This is this will be r m n why not our M N will be our may now and then we have here.

22
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:54,400
What's it made of those look like.

23
00:00:54,470 --> 00:00:55,700
It looks like stone right.

24
00:00:55,750 --> 00:00:58,230
OK so materials stone.

25
00:00:58,230 --> 00:00:59,930
Is it is it big or is it small.

26
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:02,430
Was pretty simple it's pretty small.

27
00:01:02,490 --> 00:01:06,570
What feeling do I get when I look at this whole scene.

28
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:08,000
What is the atmosphere.

29
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:13,320
Remember we talked about atmosphere earlier in the class the feeling we get from a place where the atmosphere

30
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:20,610
here is if I look at this scene little there's a little lake here that's supposed to be water lake some

31
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:23,250
trees nothing else around.

32
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:26,820
Pretty lonely let's use lonely and where is it.

33
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:27,960
Where is this place.

34
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:30,340
Well it's let's just say it's in the countryside.

35
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:37,020
So we'll add countryside that's where it is and I'm gonna make countryside not the adjective for this

36
00:01:37,050 --> 00:01:39,420
I'm going to make countryside where it all is.

37
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:45,090
So we'll use small stone lonely three adjectives and we'll use cottage.

38
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:52,380
Remember we used with four for the car we say with for what the cottage has it's got a it's got a roof

39
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:54,680
but it's kind of a special roof.

40
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:55,270
Right.

41
00:01:55,350 --> 00:02:03,120
It's kind of a weird roof this kind of roof with straw on the top is called a thatched roof thatched.

42
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:09,960
I didn't mention this in the vocabulary at the start of the class because if you don't remember the

43
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:10,850
word fat.

44
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:11,520
That's OK.

45
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:19,260
It's not a really common word so let's just use fast as a way to describe the roof and it's obviously

46
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:20,160
beside a lake.

47
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:23,460
So I think we can put thatched countryside.

48
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:24,530
We can talk about the roof.

49
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:27,750
We can put all of this in our first sentence.

50
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:34,860
I will write it all down very clearly later on but we could say as our first sentence there is always

51
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:38,400
a good way to begin a description of something you're looking at.

52
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:53,520
There is a small lonely stone cottage with a thatched roof thatched roof beside a lake beside a lake

53
00:02:53,550 --> 00:03:01,000
and we could say beside Blue Lake or we could add adjectives there to beside a lake in the countryside.

54
00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:08,620
There is a small lonely stone cottage with a thatched roof beside a lake in the countryside.

55
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:11,320
OK so that's a pretty simple first sentence again.

56
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:16,350
I'll write it down in a little bit but that's a pretty easy way to describe it.

57
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:19,530
And the picture that you get in your mind is very clear.

58
00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:22,770
But now we want to go further we want to describe the other things too.

59
00:03:22,770 --> 00:03:24,770
There's a lot more going on here.

60
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:26,880
What else does the cottage have.

61
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:34,140
Well it has a square window there's a little a little square window it's a little square window small

62
00:03:34,170 --> 00:03:35,460
that's the size.

63
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:38,960
Don't use small again because we already said Small.

64
00:03:38,970 --> 00:03:42,390
And if you use small small small too many times that's not good.

65
00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:44,310
That's called repetition.

66
00:03:44,310 --> 00:03:51,420
We don't usually want repetition if you can use another word like teeny or little or something like

67
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:51,930
that.

68
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:53,940
That's often better because it's different.

69
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,140
It sounds better.

70
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:59,710
So little in the shape square window and that's at the front of the house.

71
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:06,840
So there's a little square window at the front and then beside that we can connect the door to the window

72
00:04:06,870 --> 00:04:14,080
and beside that beside what side the window beside that beside that is a single wooden door.

73
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:15,600
Wooden is the material.

74
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:18,610
If you want to say wood that's a noun it is wood.

75
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:20,260
The adjective is wooden.

76
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:24,040
A single one wooden door beside that right.

77
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:28,840
With now we can connect this little this little thing here.

78
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:34,010
This is called a let's call this a it's a path and an adjective for the path man.

79
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:37,650
Maybe narrow and what's the material of the path.

80
00:04:37,650 --> 00:04:42,450
Well it's it's dirt it's a dirt it's a dirt path a DIY Artie.

81
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:49,650
So notice that it's not only the first main noun that I'm adding more adjectives to I'm doing it for

82
00:04:49,890 --> 00:04:50,820
several of them.

83
00:04:50,870 --> 00:05:01,700
OK so there's a narrow dirt path that is leading away leading away from the from the front door or leading

84
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:08,630
toward something leading away from means it begins there and goes away leading toward something is what

85
00:05:08,630 --> 00:05:10,720
it's moving in the direction of.

86
00:05:10,790 --> 00:05:13,250
Now is the path really moving.

87
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:14,140
No it's not.

88
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:19,060
But we can use that action to make it feel like it is right.

89
00:05:19,190 --> 00:05:25,980
The road is winding up the mountain is it really the road is is just there right.

90
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,330
Yes that's true.

91
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:34,910
But the feeling of it is that it's winding its winding up the mountain it's winding its winding up the

92
00:05:34,910 --> 00:05:35,430
mountain.

93
00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:42,160
So that can really help us make the description that we have feel very active.

94
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:44,180
It's a really good way to describe things.

95
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:51,380
So I've talked about the door the window the path the roof the chimney the the actual cottage itself

96
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:52,330
where it is.

97
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:53,510
It's location.

98
00:05:53,510 --> 00:05:59,840
We have a lot of information but I want to say a couple other things before I actually get to my my

99
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:00,890
story part.

100
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:02,920
OK so what about the trees.

101
00:06:03,050 --> 00:06:07,110
So we could say that the tree is beside the house.

102
00:06:07,110 --> 00:06:07,340
Right.

103
00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:13,640
We can use beside you could say beside the house there is right beside the house.

104
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:14,480
There is.

105
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:20,360
Or if you want to make it a little bit more active you could say standing

106
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:25,730
standing beside the house there is.

107
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:29,880
Or standing beside the house is a tree.

108
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:34,680
And again we can try to make it more interesting by adding other adjectives.

109
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:39,150
This tree this tree here doesn't look very.

110
00:06:39,350 --> 00:06:40,820
Doesn't look very healthy right.

111
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:44,810
So let's use an interesting adjective let's use.

112
00:06:44,810 --> 00:06:51,790
I'm gonna use the adjective scraggly if I have room to write this I'll write it down at the bottom.

113
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:52,760
This is about the tree.

114
00:06:52,790 --> 00:06:53,420
OK.

115
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:58,160
S C R A G G L Y.

116
00:06:58,180 --> 00:07:05,150
It's an interesting adjective to use a scraggly tree scraggly tree beside the house of standing beside

117
00:07:05,150 --> 00:07:07,010
the house is a scraggly tree.

118
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:08,680
But there's another tree.

119
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:09,920
Where's the tree.

120
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:12,460
Well we could say that the tree is in the distance.

121
00:07:12,470 --> 00:07:20,130
We could say the distance or we could say in the background in the distance in the background.

122
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:27,650
So if you look at this other tree here it's in the distance and there's kind of a row of something here.

123
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:30,450
Let's call these bushes hedges.

124
00:07:30,470 --> 00:07:31,910
Let's call them hedges.

125
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:42,560
HEDGES HPD G.S. so we have one tree here at scraggly we have another in the distance and it's by a row

126
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:45,500
a row a row of hedges.

127
00:07:45,530 --> 00:07:47,170
So we kind of have all the pieces.

128
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:53,160
Now we want to put all the pieces together and then we want to use our imagination.

129
00:07:53,210 --> 00:08:00,740
So what we're going to do next is I'm going to put all this into one clear description a few sentences

130
00:08:01,010 --> 00:08:07,730
and then I'm going to add what I think is going on in this picture a little bit of a story based on

131
00:08:07,730 --> 00:08:09,130
my own imagination.

132
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:14,690
What I would like to add but it's very important to understand and remember that when you're describing

133
00:08:14,810 --> 00:08:17,510
first you start with the basic details.

134
00:08:17,510 --> 00:08:22,230
First you make clear sentences that have lots of information.

135
00:08:22,310 --> 00:08:29,570
You use lots of adjectives in front of main nouns and then you can add interesting stuff.

136
00:08:29,570 --> 00:08:35,960
You can say who lives here you can say how long they've lived here but if you start with that in many

137
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:39,890
cases it will be more confusing and people will go huh.

138
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:41,180
What's he talking about.

139
00:08:41,180 --> 00:08:42,330
Who's living here.

140
00:08:42,350 --> 00:08:43,300
Where are they living.

141
00:08:43,310 --> 00:08:43,670
What.

142
00:08:44,090 --> 00:08:47,150
So let's look at how we can put it all together.
