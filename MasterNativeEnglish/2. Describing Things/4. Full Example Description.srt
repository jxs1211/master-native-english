1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,840
OK so let's look at what we have altogether OK.

2
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:14,940
There is a small lonely stone cottage with a thatched roof beside a lake in the countryside.

3
00:00:14,970 --> 00:00:24,030
It has a little square window at the front and beside that a single wooden door with a narrow dirt path

4
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:28,410
that leads away toward the nearby village.

5
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:30,860
Maybe there's a village nearby.

6
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:41,250
Standing beside the cottage is a small scraggly tree and in the distance there's a bigger one behind

7
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:46,750
a row of hedges bigger what one means a tree because we just mentioned trees.

8
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:56,250
So if we say one we know it's a tree a bigger one a bigger one behind a row of hedges an old potato

9
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:59,450
farmer lives here with his dog Linus.

10
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:01,270
It's my imagination.

11
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:03,190
It's a peaceful place again.

12
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:04,350
That's the atmosphere.

13
00:01:04,350 --> 00:01:05,670
It's a peaceful place.

14
00:01:05,730 --> 00:01:14,170
They sometimes go for walks along the lake in the evening when the weather is warm the sun setting over

15
00:01:14,170 --> 00:01:22,240
the water reminds the old man of strolls strolls means slow casual walks strolls he used to take with

16
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:25,820
his wife before she passed away.

17
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:28,000
This is a very sad story I imagine.

18
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,400
What's wrong with me.

19
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:32,020
Why did I have to put that sad thing at the end.

20
00:01:32,740 --> 00:01:33,790
Oh my goodness.

21
00:01:33,790 --> 00:01:34,930
I have a real problem.

22
00:01:35,530 --> 00:01:38,320
So you can see how it all fits together.

23
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:44,120
Before I mention my imagination I make sure to say the important details.

24
00:01:44,230 --> 00:01:52,540
Then when I get into my imagination the sad story of this lonely man and his dog Linus lived by the

25
00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:53,450
lake.

26
00:01:53,790 --> 00:02:01,650
We like to reminisce and remember the old times sad story is first based on that description.

27
00:02:01,660 --> 00:02:06,220
But you're now there with me in your mind right.

28
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:10,430
Because we've been through the description you have a clear picture first.

29
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:15,160
Then you're able to feel something when I actually describe what the man does.

30
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:18,220
The potato farmer that I invented that I imagine.

31
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:22,800
So that's the basic idea of describing things clearly.

32
00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:25,950
Again you can use it for lots of different situations.

33
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:31,300
Not only describing houses they can use it for many different things you can use it to describe your

34
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:32,050
dreams.

35
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:37,450
You can use it to describe ideas you can use it to describe what you're looking at out the window what

36
00:02:37,450 --> 00:02:39,700
you want somebody to buy at the supermarket.

37
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:48,220
Description is one of the things at the very foundation of being able to express yourself in English

38
00:02:48,450 --> 00:02:49,220
clearly.

39
00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:52,460
Now your assignment to practice is to do the same thing.

40
00:02:52,460 --> 00:02:59,380
What I'd like you to do is find a picture of a house and then try to describe it in vivid very clear

41
00:02:59,410 --> 00:03:00,610
detail.

42
00:03:00,610 --> 00:03:07,840
Make sure that you use several adjectives and make sure that you choose a main noun especially for the

43
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:09,220
first sentence.

44
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:16,420
Then after you do that and you've made a couple of clear sentences to describe what people can see to

45
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:24,250
get a feeling for the place then imagine a story and add some interesting description in your story

46
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:28,470
that is based on based on your basic description.

47
00:03:28,570 --> 00:03:34,480
OK so try this practice it you can do it for a couple of different things if you want to try a picture

48
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:40,690
of a person or if you want to try maybe something you just imagine that's fine but make sure that you

49
00:03:40,690 --> 00:03:47,500
actually are doing something as a way to get comfortable with description because it's again really

50
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:48,490
really important.
