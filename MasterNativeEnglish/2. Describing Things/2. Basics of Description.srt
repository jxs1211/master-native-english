1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:04,860
If you remember anything at all about this lesson remember this.

2
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:12,630
This is probably the most important thing to know when it comes to describing things clearly.

3
00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:19,380
If you can do this well you should be able to describe anything you need to describe and put the idea

4
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:23,050
of that thing very clearly in another person's mind.

5
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:24,110
So this is it.

6
00:00:24,110 --> 00:00:24,720
OK.

7
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:31,020
We're going to look at these four very simple sentences and we're going to look at why it's bad.

8
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:36,780
And then we're going to talk about how we can make it really clear the first sentence of a description

9
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:38,670
is really really important.

10
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:44,850
If you say the basic details of something much much later when you're describing it then people will

11
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:46,400
be lost from the beginning.

12
00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:47,070
Right.

13
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:54,440
So we need to know how to say the most important simple details first like the foundation of a house.

14
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:57,870
Then we can build on that by adding things to it.

15
00:00:57,870 --> 00:01:04,410
For example if we're telling a story if you just say and I was so scared because the horse jumped right

16
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:07,280
over the fence and nearly crushed me.

17
00:01:07,410 --> 00:01:11,760
People will say what horse What fence what's happening here.

18
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:20,430
But if we set the scene we say set the scene where when what Who what's going on here then people have

19
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:22,610
a clear picture of OK you're here.

20
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:24,150
It was this time.

21
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:29,020
I know you know what how big the horse was and why you were in this place.

22
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:36,840
Then you can say how you felt then you can explain more details about what happened right then you can

23
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:41,490
talk about your ideas or whatever but you have to have that thing at the beginning.

24
00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:41,750
OK.

25
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:48,330
So let's look at these four sentences and talk about how we can do this how we can set the scene and

26
00:01:48,330 --> 00:01:51,470
give the basic details first in our description.

27
00:01:51,510 --> 00:01:54,030
So number one I have a car.

28
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:55,230
It's a Ford.

29
00:01:55,230 --> 00:01:57,160
Ford is a brand of car.

30
00:01:57,210 --> 00:02:00,850
I think you probably know that it has four doors.

31
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:02,430
It is yellow.

32
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:03,560
It is yellow.

33
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:07,890
It has a good stereo the stereo is stereo.

34
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:16,680
By the way if you don't know is the sound system in the car or when you have two speakers left and on

35
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:17,730
the right.

36
00:02:17,730 --> 00:02:17,970
OK.

37
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,460
This is not good right.

38
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:26,290
Because so many sentences and each sentence only has really one piece of information.

39
00:02:26,370 --> 00:02:29,490
One thing to know so it's not very good.

40
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:38,280
It's better if we use one sentence maybe two to say all the basic details we need at the beginning of

41
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:39,220
a description.

42
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:41,890
I would recommend you use one sentence.

43
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:47,450
So rule number one use one sentence at the beginning of a description.

44
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:49,480
Use one very clear sentence.

45
00:02:49,530 --> 00:02:53,760
Rule number two is use more than one adjective.

46
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:57,290
More than one adjective.

47
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:58,840
I'm going to write a D.J..

48
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:00,120
That's a J.

49
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:07,530
More than one adjective when you're describing something in front of your main noun OK.

50
00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:11,410
So just to be clear adjectives things like yellow.

51
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:11,790
Right.

52
00:03:11,970 --> 00:03:16,560
And we can make other adjectives to make it clear what we're talking about.

53
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:21,390
We can use more than one but we also need to know what our main noun is.

54
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:28,290
So we have to choose a main noun and then put three or four adjectives in front of that to make it really

55
00:03:28,290 --> 00:03:33,360
really clear what we're talking about and to give the other person a very clear picture.

56
00:03:33,390 --> 00:03:33,690
OK.

57
00:03:34,050 --> 00:03:40,790
So more than one adjective and three have a main noun.

58
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:41,130
OK.

59
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:47,100
So we use one sentence we use more than one adjective and we have a main noun.

60
00:03:47,130 --> 00:03:51,570
Let's look at how we can do that with these sentences.

61
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:51,800
OK.

62
00:03:51,830 --> 00:03:56,480
So which of these can we turn into or use as adjectives for the main noun.

63
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:57,790
And which is the main noun.

64
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:01,830
Well this sentence is not really necessary.

65
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:10,070
So we can cancel it if Ford is R may noun because Ford is a kind of car right.

66
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:18,240
So if we say Ford is our main noun we don't need that and maybe we can even add more information.

67
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:24,060
Let's say this this Ford is from let's say it's from 1998 right.

68
00:04:24,090 --> 00:04:25,960
Let's say it's nineteen ninety eight.

69
00:04:26,010 --> 00:04:26,940
That's an adjective.

70
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:32,140
1998 can be used as an adjective can be yellow.

71
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:35,490
Obviously yellow is an adjective for doors.

72
00:04:35,490 --> 00:04:37,470
Can that be made into an adjective.

73
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:38,420
Yes.

74
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:45,780
If you have something like a five year old child write a five year old child or five year old girl for

75
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:54,940
example or 32 page book all you're doing there is adding a hyphen it's a hyphen.

76
00:04:54,950 --> 00:04:55,870
It's called a hyphen.

77
00:04:55,910 --> 00:05:00,250
H y p h e n h y p yet.

78
00:05:00,350 --> 00:05:02,980
And you're making it into an adjective.

79
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:10,580
A 42 hyphen page book a five hyphen year hyphen old girl five year old girl.

80
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:15,430
You're making new adjectives so all we have to do to make this an adjective is take.

81
00:05:15,450 --> 00:05:25,280
S Because adjectives can not be plural can have yellows for example and we make it for hyphen door for

82
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:25,980
door.

83
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:27,600
So let's see what we can do.

84
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:37,880
May noun for adjective nineteen 1998 for door adjective yellow adjectives so we're gonna use three adjectives

85
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:44,480
here in front of the main note we could do four but let's use three for now and then in the same sentence

86
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:50,540
we're going to put with them we're going to add something about the stereo we can do the same thing

87
00:05:50,540 --> 00:05:56,150
with in sometimes if we want to say the location but this is all going to be one sentence so let's try

88
00:05:56,150 --> 00:06:08,480
this I have a yellow four door 1998 Ford and if we wanted to say what type of car it is maybe an SUV

89
00:06:08,810 --> 00:06:16,010
or a van or a truck if it's a special type of vehicle then that's your new main noun it's a yellow Ford

90
00:06:16,010 --> 00:06:24,140
or 98 98 Ford SUV now SUV is the main noun and Ford becomes like an adjective it's used as an adjective.

91
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:32,570
But let's just say Ford for now I have a yellow Ford or a 1998 Ford with a good stereo look at this

92
00:06:32,630 --> 00:06:38,260
one sentence and we have so much information a yellow very clear four door OK.

93
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:38,710
Got it.

94
00:06:38,710 --> 00:06:39,940
Nineteen ninety eight OK.

95
00:06:39,950 --> 00:06:41,870
Kind of old Ford brand.

96
00:06:41,870 --> 00:06:48,680
Got it with a good stereo I have a very clear picture now in my mind I didn't need to make many sentences

97
00:06:48,930 --> 00:06:54,560
a nice say it right at the beginning so now I can say something else about it now maybe I can tell a

98
00:06:54,560 --> 00:07:04,190
story about my 1998 car my 1998 Ford right I can tell a story because you started with this clear picture

99
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:06,970
in your mind the story will now make sense.

100
00:07:06,980 --> 00:07:14,540
So whatever we add after it it's going to make more sense because the first sentence was extremely clear.

101
00:07:14,610 --> 00:07:15,350
OK.

102
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:17,080
This is the main idea.

103
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:21,650
This is the most important thing to learn about description if you can do this.

104
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:23,170
Choose your main noun.

105
00:07:23,330 --> 00:07:24,520
Have several adjectives.

106
00:07:24,530 --> 00:07:31,940
Two three four sometimes five if you can turn some things into adjectives like four door and you can

107
00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:41,840
use nouns as adjectives like 1998 and Ford if we want to say SUV if you can do that then you become

108
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:47,720
a lot more powerful with your descriptions and then you can add more stuff after it in the same sentence

109
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:49,640
with a good stereo.

110
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:51,730
Now let's see if we can do this with a real picture.

111
00:07:51,730 --> 00:07:57,800
We're going to take a picture and we're going to talk about how we can describe it clearly as part of

112
00:07:58,100 --> 00:08:00,590
a kind of story or the beginning of a story.
