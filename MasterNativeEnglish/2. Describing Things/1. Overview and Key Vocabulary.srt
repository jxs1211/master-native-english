1
00:00:03,930 --> 00:00:11,940
Now in this first real lesson we're gonna start with description description means being able to explain

2
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:15,000
what something actually looks like.

3
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:20,570
Or to give details about something so that other people can really understand.

4
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:26,790
We're going to talk about description first because it's so important whether you're telling somebody

5
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:31,230
what to do how to do something what something looks like.

6
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:37,140
For example if you're on the phone and you're talking to somebody you need to be able to explain sometimes

7
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:41,730
where to go or what you're looking at because you're on the phone.

8
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:43,760
They can't see what you're seeing.

9
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:51,000
So if you're able to describe something very very clearly then you'll be very very powerful.

10
00:00:51,230 --> 00:00:51,770
OK.

11
00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:59,760
So in this first real lesson we're going to focus on that because it's the foundation of a lot of basic

12
00:01:00,150 --> 00:01:01,440
communication.

13
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:04,300
So we're going to use a visual example today.

14
00:01:04,410 --> 00:01:10,470
That means we're going to actually look at something and talk about how to describe it well but I want

15
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:18,130
to be clear that you can use a lot of the things that we're talking about today in many other situations.

16
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:23,820
We're gonna start by talking about a few key words some vocabulary words and then we're going to work

17
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:29,570
on a few skills really important descriptions skills and then we'll do an example.

18
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:35,190
I actually have made something for you to look at and we're going to actually try to describe it together

19
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:38,500
that we can really get a feel for this.

20
00:01:38,550 --> 00:01:38,840
OK.

21
00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:44,450
So some basic vocabulary first before we do anything we need to know the word physical.

22
00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:50,400
So physical thing is something that you can touch something that you can feel something that you can

23
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:51,360
look at.

24
00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:54,790
Often we say we say an object.

25
00:01:55,020 --> 00:02:02,610
So this word has several different meanings but one meaning of this is is a thing a physical thing is

26
00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:04,600
often called an object.

27
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:12,990
So when we're describing a physical thing we'll use colors we'll use texture texture is the surface

28
00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:19,110
of something but if it's not something that we're feeling then we might talk about the materials we

29
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:22,840
might talk about the materials and that means what it's made of right.

30
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:26,920
So there are a lot of different things that make up something that is physical.

31
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:31,460
If it's not physical then we say it is non-physical.

32
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:34,510
What would be something that's non-physical.

33
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:40,410
Well we often called non-physical things things that happen maybe in our minds like a dream.

34
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:46,290
Let's say you have a very very strange dream where you would describe that right but that's something

35
00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:48,950
that didn't really happen you can't touch it.

36
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:52,680
And so it's non-physical or how you feel an emotion.

37
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:54,030
Right that's a thing.

38
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:55,260
But you can't really touch it.

39
00:02:55,280 --> 00:03:02,970
So it's non-physical an idea hopes you know this sort of thing describing something that happens here

40
00:03:02,970 --> 00:03:05,110
is often non-physical.

41
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:11,690
OK so hopes dreams ideas are non-physical.

42
00:03:11,850 --> 00:03:16,910
I'm looking down to see and I'm looking down sometimes to see what I'm actually writing.

43
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:23,310
Just so you know OK atmosphere than atmosphere has lots of different meanings but in this case we're

44
00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:29,580
using atmosphere to talk about the feeling of a place when you go into a restaurant you say oh I really

45
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:37,290
like the the atmosphere here we often also use the word vibe if you really like how a restaurant feels

46
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:42,650
you can say this restaurant has a really really nice vibe I like the vibe here OK.

47
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:47,780
This is also the atmosphere atmosphere can also be for example for a whole city.

48
00:03:47,790 --> 00:03:52,590
The city of Chicago has a very very cool atmosphere a cool vibe.

49
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:55,310
Now you can use vibe for people.

50
00:03:55,350 --> 00:04:02,400
I get a very strange vibe from that guy a very strange vibe but we usually don't use atmosphere for

51
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:06,480
people we wouldn't say you are giving me a very strange atmosphere.

52
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:07,730
Probably not.

53
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:14,730
So we're we're going to use atmosphere in this class to talk about the general feeling of of a place

54
00:04:14,730 --> 00:04:15,680
of a location.

55
00:04:15,690 --> 00:04:21,540
We also need to talk about two specific words that we're going to use later on in the class when we

56
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:22,890
actually look at something.

57
00:04:22,890 --> 00:04:30,590
One is cottage and a cottage is a very small simple house and it's often made of stone.

58
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:34,270
And it's often by a lake or something near some water.

59
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:37,000
Usually we call it a cottage.

60
00:04:37,230 --> 00:04:43,890
A chimney is then something that goes on top of the house on the roof of the House and has smoke going

61
00:04:43,890 --> 00:04:44,400
through it.

62
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:52,020
If there's a fire in the house in the fireplace in the fireplace then there will be smoke coming through

63
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:56,070
the chimney and usually the chimney is made of stone or brick.

64
00:04:56,070 --> 00:05:03,160
So those two words will make sense more later in the class when we actually practice option so physical

65
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:10,510
non-physical atmosphere the feeling of a place the vibe we need to also know cottage and we need to

66
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:13,980
know chimney we'll learn other words too later on in the class.

67
00:05:13,990 --> 00:05:19,390
But make sure to especially remember these key words because these are important in this class.
