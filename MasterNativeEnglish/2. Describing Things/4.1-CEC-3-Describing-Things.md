This house I'd like to describe is my workplace, it is in a white 8-floor 2002 building with two old elevators allocated in the B district of TianFu Software Park in the south of the city.

The office is at the first floor with many floor-to-ceiling windows at every direction of the building, and beside that a single front door with electrical control and badge permit that leads away toward the front hall. 

Surrounding the office building are many green plants, especially, there is a big tree beside the south of the office, In this distant, there is a McDonald's which is behind another office building. Sometimes, I'd like to have some breakfast or brunch there. 

It is also convenient to get the office because there is subway station nearby. I usually take a subway to commute there every working day. There is also a park just two blocks away from the office. Sometimes I'd click to take a walk and have some fresh air there with my colleagues after a long time work. Totally, it is a good place where I like to work.
