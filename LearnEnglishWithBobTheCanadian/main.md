Because I'm ready to head out the door and go to work.
The next thing I do in my daily routine is take subway to work. Becuase for me, at this time, I go to work.
One of the reasons/things that I like about my commute to work is that I could spend some time on practicing my English on the train. It takes about half an hours to the workplace.

when I get to work, I take off my jacket, and hang up the jacket, and say hi to everybody. 
I put my lunch my in the fridge, because I arrive the office early about 1 hour before work, so I could do something that I would like to do, like grab some English learning materials, watch youtube videoes or something.

After that, I grab some dish for lunch. Sometimes I order a dish on meituan, sometimes I get something that I cook for lunch in advance. For the breaking time, I usually watch some youtube videoes or chat with my colleagues.

Sometimes I bug some groceries and those types of things, before I run some errands I will check my WeChat and text message, because I want to find out is there anything my family might need from town before I go home.

And My family text me back said that we need some more bananas, and there is nothing else they can think of that we need to get in town, basically we only need some bananas so I'm going to run one errands, I'm going to the grocery store for banana.

When I say I pick out or choose banans, these two verbs mean the same thing.
I pick out bananas that are yellow and ready to eat right now. 
I like to pick out bananas that are a little bit green that we can eat later this week when they are ripe. By the way if you are from the contry grow the bananas thank you for the bananas. 
Sometimes I attemped to buy myself some snacks, I resisted the temptation because I'm losing weight.
I've finished running errands and my workday.
The next thing I normally do in my daily routine is go home. I go home and I head home are both common phrases in English and mean exactly the same thing.
The next thing I do everyday after I get home from work is I say hi to my kids. See I really do have five kids. After that I usually go the the gym and take a swim, some people like to do some body phyical exercise, but I like to swim, so I go to the gym with my swimming wear.
It's not that hard to swim than you might think. There are 4 different style of swimming stroke, you can choose one of them to swim earier.
I usually swim three different type of style when I'm swimming. I swim for around half an hour.
The next thing I do in my day is I make dinner.
I usually boil some noodles for dinner with sauce, and I fry a egg and boil some vegetables for making noodles. That meal is healthy.
First I fried a egg and put it away for a while.
And then I will boil some water in pan, after the water is heated and bubbling nicely, I will put some vegetables into the water.
After the vegetables is boiled nicely, I pick them out, and put noodles into the water, when the noodles is boiled nicely, I pick them out and add the fried egg into the noodles.
So everything is cooking nicely, I have a good meal. At the same time I would like watch some drama that I'm into. 
After the meal, I will wash the dishes. I also dry the dishes.
As soon as the dishes are done, I spend a little bit of time tiding up the kitchen.
After supper, I will probably sit on the couch for a little bit while to just relax and unwind. I might turn on the TV and watch the news, I might just read a book a little while. I might grab my laptop to watch youtube video or maybe some drama on Netflix.
As I sitting on the coush for relaxing, my child usually go to bed one by one. They will say good night to me before they go to bed.
At about 10:00 p.m., it's for to get ready for bed.
I do a few things to get ready for bed.
I brush my teeth and wash my face, I use the bathroom and you are still not invited in,by the way, and then I put on my pajamas, and I get into bed.
So one of the last thing I do in my daily routine is I get into bed. After I get into bed, there's just two things left to do, i need to set my alarm clock, so that I don't sleep in tomorrow. Because I need to do this daily routine all over again.
The last thing I do in my daily basis is I go to sleep.
Good night. See you tomorrow.
