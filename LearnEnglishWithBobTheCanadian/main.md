```
We will talk about from the momnet I wake up until the end of my day.
The very first thing I do everyday, I'm waking up from sleeping by the alarm clock, and then I press the snooze button on my alarm clock. I usually wanna sleep a little bit more when my alarm goes off. I will wake up again by the alarm clock at the second time.
I get out of my bed and go to the bathroom.
I will make my bed nice after I really get up.
I wash my face and brush my teeth in the bathroom. shave my beard.
Sometimes I will make myself breakfast.
I fry two eggs in frying pan.
I make myself a mug of milk.
I make two pieces of toasts in the toaster.
That's a standard my breakfast.
I eat my egg on toast.
I drink my coffee from my favorite mug.
I spend a little bit time of doing(checking my social media like tiktok...)
So the next part of my daily routine you are not invited to because I take a shower every morning.
After that I dry off with a towel and put on some deodorant, then I get dressed what I decide to wear today.
Before I leave my home, I will take my lunch that I made yesterday.
I put the lunch in my lunch bag.

I grab my things like keys, wallet, cellphone, earphone, laptop, of course the lunch that I make.
Because I'm ready to head out the door and go to work.
The next thing I do in my daily routine is take subway to work. Becuase for me, at this time, I go to work.
One of the reasons/things that I like about my commute to work is that I could spend some time on practicing my English on the train. It takes about half an hours to the workplace.

when I get to work, I take off my jacket, and hang up the jacket, and say hi to everybody. 
I put my lunch my in the fridge, because I arrive the office early about 1 hour before work, so I could do something that I would like to do, like grab some English learning materials, watch youtube videoes or something.
I usually make myself a cup of vetamin tablet with my favorite mug, and grab some breakfast.
I usually work from 9:30 to 12:00 in the morning.
Sometimes I design technical solution and have discussion with team member from time to time. Of course coding and debuging is definitely part of my daily work. I plan some tasks for next serval weeks.
After that, I grab some dish for lunch. Sometimes I order a dish on meituan, sometimes I get something that I cook for lunch in advance. For the breaking time, I usually watch some youtube videoes or chat with my colleagues.

After that, I go back to my work and continue to do what I'm engaged before.

I go back to home after work, sometimes I propably run some errands before I go home 

I login my computer and check the mail and read the news.
