         - **Different genre music effects you differently**. Aloud and fast music make you alert and easier to focus on thing, soft and slow music give you a comfortable feeling and make you calm down
         - **Singing and personal development**: Not only does singing give us a natural high, it’s pretty great for our mental wellbeing too. Learning a song is a complicated task for the brain. You have to be coordinated enough to sing the right words at the right time, using the correct pitch and volume, and learn to sing along with other people.
         - **The physical benefits of singing**: Singing involves lots of deep breathing, meaning we take more oxygen into our bloodstream. Controlled breathing also increases lung capacity and has a calming effect on the singer.
         When we sing we stand up straighter and expand our chest, improving posture and toning the diaphragm. We stretch our facial muscles and exercise our vocal chords, which helps in keeping us looking and sounding younger. As an aerobic activity, singing is good for our heart health. It tones the core and ab muscles, stimulates circulation and boosts the immune system. Singing also clears the sinuses, aids sleep, and can help people recover from mental health issues like depression or anxiety.
         - **What happens on a chemical level when we sing**: 
           - boosts endorphin flow
           - resulting in a sense of euphoria, enhanced immune response, and a natural pain relief.
           - helps relieve anxiety and stimulates feelings of trust
